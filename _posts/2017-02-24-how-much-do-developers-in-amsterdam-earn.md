There are between [1,900 and 2,600 tech startups](http://blog.honeypot.io/amsterdam-tech-map/) in the Amsterdam-Startup Delta, the geographical triangle, which covers Amsterdam, the Hague and Eindhoven. Whatsmore, large tech companies such as Uber, Tesla, Avazu, Elastic and Atlassian, have major offices in the Dutch Capital. That means a lot of demand for developers. But how does this demand translate into the average salary of a developer in Amsterdam?

We gathered data from our platform to see the average salaries offered by companies to developers in Amsterdam. This data is taken from 300 offers which have been sent in the last four months. It should be noted that these figures are averages and do not take into account differences which can result from programming languages. In future blog posts, we will dive deeper into the data. 

Nonetheless, these figures give some insight into average salaries for developers in Amsterdam. The results of our findings are outlined below:

According to [Compass](http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/), the proportion of developers with prior experience is lower than in other European startup hubs. Competition is fierce among employers for those developers with previous experience, especially given the resources of large tech companies such as Booking.com and TomTom. For startups based in Amsterdam, hiring developers remains one of the biggest challenges to growth.

Frontend development tools have come a long way in the last few years. CSS preprocessors, JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and JavaScript testing tools improve workflow, speed up development and provide greater possibilities for responsive design.

But keeping up with the latest the latest JavaScript libraries and frameworks can be challenging. Our friend [Ashley Nolan](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2015-results), set out to crowdsource the answers. 2,028 developers completed his survey on frontend developer tools and we summarized the results in this infographic. Stay tuned to Ashley’s blog for updates on the survey!

Below you will find a summary of the three the most interesting findings from Ashley Nolan’s survey:
 
## The most popular CSS preprocessor: 
The most popular CSS preprocessor is by far Sass with almost **64% of surveyed selecting Sass as their favourite**. Coming in second is Less with 15% of the votes, while an equal 15% have stated that they use no preprocessor. A mere 4% are using Stylus while 2% selected the option “other”.

## The most popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks:
This might be one of the most interesting findings of Ashley Nolan’s developer survey, as it attempts to answer the age-old question what are the most used JavaScript libraries and frameworks? **More than half (56%) answered jQuery**, while almost 18% answered AngularJS, followed by roughly 9% choosing React. Only 8% use native JavaScript, while the remaining 9% is scattered across Backbone, Ember, Knockout, Underscore and Polymer. 

## The most popular JavaScript testing tools:
Considering how sought after code testing skills are amongst the Berlin-based startups, it was quite surprisingly to find that **almost 60% of surveyed answered that they don’t use any tools** for testing their JavaScript. However, the two most popular testing tools are Jasmine and Mocha with respectively 16% and 15% of respondents choosing it as their favourite JavaScript testing tool. QUnit was favoured by roughly 4%, while Tape, Jest, Karma, Intern and “Other” was selected by roughly 1%.

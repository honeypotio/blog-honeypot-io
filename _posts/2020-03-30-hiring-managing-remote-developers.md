If there’s one thing we’ve learned from COVID-19, it’s that working from home has actually proved very manageable, and the cloud of assumptions surrounding distributed teams have been set straight. This pandemic has already defined the future of work, and while the crisis will surely end, the trend towards remote work will not.

In light of recent events, we’ve created a five-part series on remote hiring and management. Each part documents the best practices from the tech community and a few of our own, and we’ll take you through the processes: from sourcing and interviewing, to hiring and onboarding, to managing and engaging teams. You’ll find the links to the series below and a quick snapshot of what you can expect to learn. Enjoy the read, amigo!

## Part 2: How to Interview Developers Remotely

As tech companies, we put in a great deal of effort to create an excellent candidate experience; furnishing our meeting rooms with the latest technology and rounding it out with fresh bottles of sparkling. Unfortunately the government wasn’t thinking about our interview processes when they implemented social distancing and quarantine rules: no more face-to-face interviews, no trial days, no more office tours :(

But it’s not all doom and gloom. In [Part 2](https://blog.honeypot.io/interview-hire-developers-remotely/) of our remote hiring and managing guide we’ll talk you through the entire remote interview process, from how to prepare for the interview to what you’ll need to do afterwards, and towards your next successful remote hire.

## Part 3: How to Onboard Developers Remotely

It’s no secret that developers love remote work 一 they, along with most workers, actually prefer it! But where most companies fail is with the onboarding process. A recent Gallup survey found the majority of respondents were not happy with their company’s onboarding process! 

Now our onboarding processes have been taken online, and in that transition there’s plenty of room for error and improvement. In [this part](https://blog.honeypot.io/onboard-developers-remotely/) of our series we’ll share some remote onboarding practices which will help to create a smooth and memorable experience for your new remote workers.

## Part 5: How to engage remote engineering teams

We all know how important our company’s culture is 一 a healthy culture leads to a proactive and successful workplace while attracting great talent. But when we suddenly remove the office, the desk-buddies, the team lunches, the parties and all the team events we enjoy so much 一 what happens to our culture?

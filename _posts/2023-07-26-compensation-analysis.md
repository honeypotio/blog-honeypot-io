Money isn't everything, but let's face it: we all want to be compensated fairly for our hard work. When talented candidates are weighing their options, a competitive salary and benefits package can be the deciding factor.

That's why HR leaders know that getting compensation right is crucial for attracting, inspiring, and holding onto top performers. So, how can organisations be sure that they're offering fair and competitive compensation? That's where compensation analysis comes in.

By using this valuable tool, companies can gain insights into industry standards, market trends, and other key factors that influence employee pay.

With compensation analysis on their side, organisations can make data-driven decisions that keep employees feeling valued, motivated, and engaged.


## What is compensation analysis?

Compensation analysis is a systematic process used by organisations to assess their competitiveness and internal pay equity. It acts as a GPS for navigating the ever-changing job market. 

By undertaking this type of analysis, HR leaders can shape compensation plans that not only attract and retain top talent but also maintain [internal equity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/employee-turnover-retention-problems-is-pay-the-problem.aspx&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1690369656847869&usg=AOvVaw3td2wrqpDXcHwhXvN8P_yB/) and fit within budget constraints. This data-driven approach helps organisations create fair and competitive pay structures that support their business objectives.

### Advantages of using compensation analyses

Implementing a comprehensive compensation analysis can provide numerous advantages for organisations. It is a strategic move that can help companies stay competitive in today's talent market.

By conducting a compensation analysis, you can:

- Attract and retain top talent by ensuring your pay scales are competitive and [aligned with industry standards](https://bit.ly/4773eIL).
- Promote pay equity and mitigate discrimination risks by making data-supported decisions.
- Boost employee morale by demonstrating a commitment to fair compensation practices.
- Align your pay practices with your overall business objectives and budget constraints.
- Identify any inconsistencies or gaps in your pay structures and take action to rectify these issues, creating a more equitable workplace.

In short, compensation analysis is a powerful tool for organizations looking to optimize their compensation strategy and stay ahead of the competition.

### How often should organisations conduct a compensation analysis?

The frequency with which organisations should conduct compensation analysis can vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization as well as external factors such as industry trends and changes in the job market.

However, as a general rule, it's recommended that companies review and analyse their compensation structures at least once a year to ensure they remain competitive and aligned with industry standards. Organisations conducting regular compensation analyses can keep their pay structures fair, equitable, and attractive to top talent.

## Eight steps for a successful compensation analysis

Conducting a successful compensation analysis requires a systematic and detailed approach. Follow these eight steps to ensure a thorough and effective process:

1. **Define the purpose:** Understand why you're conducting the analysis in the first place. This could be to revisit your compensation strategy, ensure pay equity, or attract top talent. Defining a single goal at the beginning will enable you to set clear project plan and gather the right data.
2. **Gather data:** Collect detailed data about the roles in your organisation, such as job descriptions, reporting structures, and responsibilities.
3. **Choose comparables:** Select comparable jobs in the market for comparison. This can be done by considering aspects like the complexity of tasks, the level of responsibility, and the skills required.
4. **Collect market data:** Gather information about compensation rates for comparable jobs from reliable sources like salary surveys, [salary reports](https://bit.ly/4773eIL), or recruitment websites.
5. **Analyse the data:** Compare your company's compensation rates with the market data. Look for disparities in pay rates, both within your organization and compared to the market.
6. **Identify pay inequities:** If there are significant pay disparities, investigate the reasons. Ensure that the differences are not due to discriminatory practices.
7. **Develop an action plan:** If inequities are identified, develop a plan to address them. Either adjusting your pay rates or revising your compensation strategy, create a clear and data-based action plan to present to the stakeholders.

## Conveying the results to the organisation

Sharing the results of a compensation analysis is a critical task that requires strategic precision. It involves professional and transparent communication with key stakeholders, including the executive team, human resources, and potentially even employees themselves.

When presenting findings to the management team, it's essential to frame the results in a way that informs their strategic decision-making process. Emphasizing the connection between [employee performance](https://hbr.org/2021/01/compensation-packages-that-actually-drive-performance) and the proposed compensation structure can foster a sense of fairness and motivate higher levels of engagement among the workforce.

If sharing results with employees, emphasize [clear and concise communication](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/can-pay-transparency-reduce-employee-turnover.aspx), delivered with sensitivity and an understanding of potential impacts.

Regardless of the audience, be sure to provide insights into the analysis methodology and offer concrete steps for addressing any issues that were uncovered. Reinforce the company's commitment to pay equity, highlighting the merit-based nature of rewards and alignment with industry standards. This approach can foster trust and confidence in the compensation analysis process while ensuring that all stakeholders feel informed and engaged.

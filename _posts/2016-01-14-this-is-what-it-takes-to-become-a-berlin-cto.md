*We researched 58 CTOs from Berlin’s biggest startups to reveal what it takes to be a CTO in this city. Combined our sample companies have raised more than  $3.06 billion in funding and span 26 industries. The research reveals the nationalities, educational and work background, years of experience and skills of Berlin's CTOs.*

##Nationalities##

Berlin’s CTOs are fairly homogenous in terms of nationality, with close to ​ 60% hailing from Germany​ . French and American are the second most common nationalities and following this there is a diverse spread covering 13 nationalities in total.

>When looking at nationality in relation to capital raised per company, it is interesting to note that while **American CTOs represent just 7% of the sample, they control 34% of the total value of the capital raised​.**  This compares to German CTOs, who control 27% of the capital raised, despite representing over 60% of the group.

##Job Titles##

Not every startup has a CTO. This can be due to the size of the company or the unique needs of the product.  80% of the companies we surveyed had a CTO. When a CTO was not present in the company, the most senior technical leaders were either SVP of Technology, VP of Engineering,  Head of IT or Chief Architect.

##Educational Background##

Despite the precedent set by the role’s name, there is some debate in tech circles about the necessity of a technical background for CTOs. On the one hand, it can be hard to manage a development team when you have little technical knowledge. On the other hand, technical skill does not necessarily translate into leadership skill.

>Our research shows that Berlin’s startups are taking diverging approaches to this challenge. **Close to a third of the companies surveyed employ CTOs with non-technical backgrounds​.** While technical background is not as important as expected, education in general is very valued: 100% of the CTOs surveyed had Bachelor degrees and over two-thirds of CTOs have reached Master level of education with backgrounds as diverse as Computer Science, ​ Art, Business Admin, and Physics.

The **most common educational path for CTOs is a bachelor in Computer Science followed by a Master in IT​.** IT can refer to degrees such as IT Management, Business Information Systems, Business IT, and in Germany ​ *Wirtschaftsinformatik* ​(Business Informatics). This educational path reflects the dual technical and business responsibility of CTOs, who to be successful must balance a variety of topics, including information system management, project management, systems analysis and design, and networks and communications.

##Skills##

##Founder Experience##

Over 60% of Berlin’s CTOs were either (co-)founders of a previous venture or (co-)founders of their current venture.  More often than not, CTOs are co-founders of the companies with which they currently work, reflecting the core technical skills which are frequently required to build a successful startup.

>The **average years of experience Berlin’s CTOs have before entering their current position is 12**, though some intrepid self-starters have entered the position just 4 years after leaving university.

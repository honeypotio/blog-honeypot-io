## About Unless

* Working location: the Netherlands
* Tech team headcount: 3
* Tech stacks:  Typescript, Serverless AWS, React.js, Astro

Started as a garage project, [Unless](https://unless.com/) has evolved into an end-to-end platform facilitating multi-channel, AI-powered conversational search focused on boosting internal productivity and ensuring customer success.

Marcel attracts developers by promoting its small team structure that offers substantial responsibility, flexible work arrangements, and involvement in the exciting field of generative AI.

## The challenge

### Time-consuming application reviews

Relying on a 'post-and-pray' approach, Marcel encountered the challenge of investing excessive time in reviewing job applications.

This diverted his focus from leading the team and optimising Unless' product.

### Unqualified talent pool

The majority of inbound applications did not align with the basic job requirements clearly outlined in Marcel's job ad.

This discrepancy made it nearly impossible for Marcel to find candidates suitable for the first interview.

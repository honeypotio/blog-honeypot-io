## About Belden

With a legacy of 120 years in cable manufacturing, [Belden](https://www.belden.com/) has evolved into a global player and hidden champion of the industrial automation industry.

## The challenge

### High hiring cost

High hiring needs coupled with the ineffectiveness of job boards led Belden to heavily rely on external agencies for tech recruitment, resulting in significant hiring costs.

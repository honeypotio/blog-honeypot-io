## The challenge

### Time-consuming talent search

Christian needed to expand his team in order to keep up with growing technical needs. However, all of the channels he was using shared one common issue: identifying suitable candidates required a substantial amount of time and energy.

Christian has to sift through numerous CVs, and many applicants failed to meet even the basic role requirements.

### Unreliable candidates

Even when Christian was able to schedule interviews with candidates who were relevant and qualified, he soon found that many were not serious about the process.

A significant number of candidates dropped out of the hiring process due to a lack of commitment to changing roles, leaving Christian back at the beginning of the hiring process.

## The solution

### Open to work talent

Unlike most channels, every talent Christian finds on Honeypot is actively seeking a new role.

This is why he likens using Honeypot to fishing in a pool where the fish want to be caught.

### Upfront salary expectations

On Honeypot, every candidate has a detailed profile that includes their salary expectations.

This helps Christian quickly shortlist compatible candidates and avoid wasting time only to find out that such crucial expectations do not align.

### Faster hiring

Christian not only had a better experience on Honeypot, but he was also able to cut his hiring time by 80%, successfully hiring his first candidate in just 20 days.

## What happened to women in computer science? 

* In the mid-80s the number of women in computer science began to drop. 
* Some argue this is because of the rise of the personal computer and its strong association with boys.
* Male computer science graduates highly outnumber female computer science graduates in the US. This pattern is repeated in Europe too. 
* Less women entering computer science education means less female technologists entering the workforce
* Less that 1/3 of software developers in the US are women.
* Once women enter technology careers the quit rate (41%) is higher than for men (17%).

## How can companies promote women in tech?

* Promote learning opportunities  for younger female developers
* Encourage female developers to speak up and pursue "creator" roles
* Foster mentors and role models

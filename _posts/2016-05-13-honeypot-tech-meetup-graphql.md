We hosted our first tech meetup last Wednesday, to a packed crowd of about 65 developers, in the new offices of [TechCode][1] near Alexanderplatz.

Facebook released an initial [GraphQL specification in July 2015][4], alongside a [Javascript reference implementation][5]. Since that time, GraphQL implmentations in various languages have emerged.

There were three talks on the evening, giving an introduction to GraphQL and then showing backend and frontend uses.

### Introduction to GraphQL: why, how and what?

The first talk of the evening was by [Oleg Ilyenko][9], the author of Sangria, a Scala GraphQL implemtation.

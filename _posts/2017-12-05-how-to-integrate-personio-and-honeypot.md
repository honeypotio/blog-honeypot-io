One of Germany’s largest **Applicant Tracking Systems** and Germany’s largest **Developer Job Platform** have joined forces to make recruiters' lives easier. As of today, Personio users can automatically upload candidates directly from Honeypot to Personio.

### How it Works

The integration enables recruiters to automatically upload candidates from **Honeypot** to **Personio**. As soon as a developer accepts your interview invite, they are automatically entered into your ATS, with the source “**Honeypot**”, together with the connecting message, the CV as a PDF, and a link to the candidate’s Honeypot profile.

The integration reduces manual effort for recruiters and hiring managers, streamlining workflow, allowing you to focus on candidate follow-up. 

### Set-up

Sign in to Honeypot and navigate to your profile on the top right of the header. Click **“Company Profile”**. From the menu, select **“Connect to ATS”**. You'll find Personio in our list of integrations.

### How to Integrate

To integrate, there are four simple fields to fill in: 

<br>

1.) **Recruiting API Access Token**: Personio > “Settings” > “API”. Copy the token and paste it into the first field of our form.

<br><br>

3.) **Account Name**: This is the name which appears in your Personio customer url (e.g https://mycompany.personio.de/).

<br>

4.) **Channel ID**: The channel first has to be created. Navigate into "Settings" > "Recruiting" > "Channels", e.g. https://mycompany.personio.de/configuration/recruiting/channels. 

You should now create a channel for Honeypot. When you click on the newly created channel you can see an associated ID. Copy the ID into this box. If the channel has already been created, you can just copy the ID directly.

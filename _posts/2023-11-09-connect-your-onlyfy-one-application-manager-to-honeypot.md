onlyfy one is one of the big players when it comes to application managers in Germany, serving more than 13000 clients with company’s like Airbus and BDO AG.
onlyfy one allows clients to bring together the entire recruiting process in one solution, allowing recruiters to be faster and more efficient with their hiring.

<!--more--> 

The onlyfy one integration enables you, as the recruiter, to automatically send candidate details from the **Honeypot** platform to the **onlyfy one application manager**.
Once the connection between Honeypot and onlyfy one is established, any developer who accepts an interview invite sent from your account will trigger the process. Once triggered, the developer’s data is automatically forwarded to onlyfy one with the ‘_Honeypot_’ tag. Forwarded data includes key contact details, work experience, educational background, skills and more.

When typing the phrase “what is DevOps” into Google a staggering amount of responses will show. Considering this is relatively new term and job function in IT has become a bit of a buzzword, there still seems to be great confusion as to what the actual role of DevOps really is?

### How DevOps started

The earliest mentions of DevOps date back to the 2008 Agile Conference and a talk on the Agile Infrastructure by Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois. Since then DevOps is well on it’s way to becoming the industry norm rather than exception. However, there seems to be no globally accepted definition of DevOps. 

### From System Admin to DevOps?

What we are experiencing first hand here at Honeypot is that a lot of awesome System Admin people have moved into the role of DevOps in their respective job markets, but there are significant knowledge gaps - particularly relating to coding skills - where the focus of System Admin is rather operative and maintenance-focused, fixing things once they go wrong, rather than adopting a more strategic, long term solution. This is not to say System Admin has become obsolete - on the contrary! Errors will still occur, and System Admins are vital for daily operations and maintenance, and DevOps cannot and should not replace Ops people. Instead DevOps should be seen as the bridge to make the lives of developers and system admin a lot easier. 

### The problem with Dev and Ops

But what exact does DevOps mean? And what caused a need for the function? Well, it is the combination of the words and job functions of Developers and Operations (or System Administrators as they are more commonly known). Developers would write code, which in isolation worked fine, but wasn’t always 100% compatible with the actual product itself. Therefore the job of a Ops or System Admin was to fix this code, ensuring it would fit with the existing code used in the product.This was a lengthy - and sometimes messy process and as the illustration below shows, there was this invisible wall distorting communication and effective work:

### How does DevOps work?

DevOps removes this incompatibility by creating code/using tools that automates and speeds up the tasks of sys admin. Previously sysadmin would have server management limitations, as they would have to complete lots of fixes, restructurings, deployments and small bits and pieces manually. With devops, these things are automated and updates/fixes can be applied to all servers automatically rather than one-by-one manually. 

### DevOps does not replace System Admin

DevOps is not a replacement for people, but a tool for improving workflow processes, infrastructure, product performance through testing and fixing. Ultimately it’s faster time to market, improved response times to customer demand, scalability and a much nicer IT environment to work in. 

### DevOps Glossary

So what tools do DevOps use? The absolute top buzzwords to look out for are Docker, Chef, Puppet and Ansible, which are all configuration tools. However, for a more detailed insight in keywords and tools, Honeypot has created the following glossary.

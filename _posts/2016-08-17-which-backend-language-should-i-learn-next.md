## Why is Scala so popular?

What’s the story behind these numbers? Why is there such a big difference between the salaries and demand of each programming language? Well, it’s more or less question of supply and demand: Scala is this “sexy” new language - very popular, but Scala developers are rare. Therefore companies are willing to pay extra to secure a Scala programmer.

## Are you more likely to find a new job working with PHP?

While Scala might be rare and sexy, the opposite can be said for PHP. PHP is great, PHP is useful, it’s been around for years - and it does the job. You might say there is an abundance of PHP developers available to companies - which is both good and bad. On one hand finding a job with PHP will be easier as more companies will be looking to fill positions, but on the other hand it also means that companies have a greater choice, which affects salaries.

## Is Java still relevant? 

Celebrating its 20th birthday this year, Java, like PHP, is one the “big boys” in the field of programming languages. Being recognised as a highly trustworthy, solid and scalable language, Java has managed to stay on top of the game for nearly twenty years - even beating C in popularity. Java developers are therefore both in high demand and can also expect a decent salary.

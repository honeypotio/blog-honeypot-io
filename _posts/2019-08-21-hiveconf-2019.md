The second edition of [HiveConf](https://hive.honeypot.io/hiveconf-2019/) is fast approaching and it promises to be another **fantastic opportunity for HR and Talent Acquisition Leaders** to gain actionable insights from some of the most respected thought leaders in the industry!

But hey, if you're still on the fence about the whole thing or just unsure how to convince your manager to let you attend, here's a quick recap of the main reasons why you'd be mad to miss it (and your manager would be mad not to let you come 😜).

## 1. We've got some awesome speakers lined up

<br />

Learn about **recruiting talent, empowering your team and HR analytics** from some of the biggest local (and global) names in recruitment and engineering, including **Kevin Goldsmith** (CTO @ Onfido and Former VP of Engineering @ Spotify and Adobe), **Leslie Kivit** (Global Recruiting @ Oculus VR / Facebook), **Eva Glanzer** (VP of People @ GetYourGuide) and **Maria Gutierrez** (Head of Engineering @ Intercom London)!

<br />

## 2. Let's get cozy

<br />

To ensure attendees get the full benefits of HiveConf, we're only selling **up to 250 tickets** and will be hosting the event in an **intimate concert venue in the heart of Kreuzberg**. Spend more time learning about relevant and well-curated #HRTech topics and less time running from room to room deciding which session to prioritize next.

<br />

## 3. Actionable insights you can apply the next day

<br />

As well as **keynotes and lightning talks** that will inspire you to create your own recipes for success, we'll have **case studies and hands-on workshops** aimed at providing you with actionable insights and learnings you can bring back to your organization. On top of that, all attendees will be given **access to speaker slides** following the event so you can easily share your learnings with the rest of your team.

<br />

## 4. Network 'til you drop

<br />

While the speakers may be the main attraction, you can't bring 250 HR and Talent Acquisition Leaders, Technical Hiring managers, CTOs and VPs of Engineering under one roof and not expect fireworks. HiveConf is a once-a-year **opportunity to exchange with like-minded professionals who are facing similar challenges** and looking for solutions of their own.

<br />

## 5. We'll take you by the hand

<br />

In case you didn't know, we the organizers (Honeypot, the latest addition to the XING group) are a **tech-focused job platform with clients in Germany and the Netherlands** and tech recruitment is our bread and butter. We'll have loads of Honeypotters (AKA HR samaritans) scouring the place, desperate to answer your questions and help you take your tech team to the next level.

## 6. The first edition was a blast

<br />

It really was! So much so that **97% of the attendees said they'd be likely to come back for HiveConf'19**. One attendee even shared that she'd been looking for an intimate HR-Tech conference like HiveConf for years! But you know what they say, videos speak louder than words (technically no one says that but you get the point), so check out the footage below and make up your own minds. 🤩

## 7. Berlin, baby!

<br />

While the whole *"I want to go to Berlin and get shit-faced"* angle might not be the best approach when it comes to convincing your boss, who in their right minds would say no to a week-end in Berlin? You know the temptation of kebabs and latte-bearing hipsters is too hard to resist.

<br />

So there you have it. HiveConf'19 is bound to be an experience to be remembered (and repeated!) and we'd love to have you with us. **Tickets are going fast though**, so [grab one while you still can!](https://hiveconf19.eventbrite.ie/?aff=blog)

See you on September 19th!

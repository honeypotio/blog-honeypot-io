"Looking for a fullstack developer" is slowly becoming a controversial tagline in any job posting. Most developers will advise steering clear of any such position, namely it might end up being a job meant to be done by two or more people. So, what is the big deal with fullstack developers?

### Who is a fullstack developer?

The definition of a fullstack developer in itself is subjective. To generalize, a fullstack developer is one who works both on the presentational side of software and the computational side. In web-development, a fullstack developer usually works on front-end and back-end concerns of a website. Back in 90s to mid-2000s web developers were synonymous with fullstack developers. As most web projects consisted of simple user interfaces generated solely by servers, it was not uncommon to have all concerns handled by servers. It meant most developers had to know how to work with back-end tasks as well as front-end related issues. So, what happened since then?


### Enter JavaScript frameworks and handheld devices

From mid-2000s, a myriad of phone and tablet devices were introduced. This coincided with the rise of JavaScript frameworks, dealing solely with front-end presentation, which was a result of a new and exciting technique called AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript & XML). Instead of web servers taking requests and returning a full rendered web-page, a page could query for specific information and update the relevant presentational part. This meant faster websites (you only request what you need when you need it) and a new approach to web technologies. A new stack was introduced.

Phones and tablets brought with them an interesting concern to web development. Previously, websites were limited to personal computers, paying no heed to different screen sizes. The advent of phones and tablets called for a re-think on how web information was presented and consumed. This also added a new concern to front-end side of things.

### The myth

[There](http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html) [are](https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/) [plenty](https://twitter.com/extraface/status/476834118584377345) of non-believers on the presence of a full-stack developers in the modern development era. Those concerns are understandable. Compared to pre-AJAX web, there are variety of concerns for one to master. A fullstack now involves:

  - Front-end
    - Design splicing and implementation
    - Responsive web implementation
    - JavaScript
      - API integration
      - Framework (or vanilla.js) implementation
      - Performance optimization
      - Unit Testing
    - Miscellaneous
      - Task runners
      - Accessibility
      - Different CSS/JS frameworks knowledge
      - Behavior Testing
  - Back-end
    - General back-end model implementation
      - Authentication/Authorization
      - API Design
    - Database
      - Database design
      - Query optimization
      - Data indexing
    - Miscellaneous
      - Data analytics (Big Data tools)[^1]
      - Unit Tests
      - Isomorphic Rendering
  - Dev Ops
    - Continuous Integration
    - Load Balancing
    - Caching
    - Virtualization
    - Server security
    - Smoke Tests

All the above, plus a multitude other business specific requirements[^2], are the 2016 concerns for a fullstack developer. A front-end or back-end developer will be able to master their relevant concerns but it is almost impossible to have find a fullstack developer capable of mastering both. However, that is not to say a developer is incapable of knowing and understanding all the concerns listed above.

### The reality

Fullstack development is mostly limited to small teams with small focused products. This can mean a developer who is familiar with one stack but rarely possessing the same knowledge on a variety of stacks. Compare this to a back-end developer who possesses the same level of mastery on two or more server languages. As a matter of fact, most small companies require fullstack developers, meaning developers who are equally comfortable on the front-end and back-end.

On the other side of the coin, most front-end or back-end developers are, to an extent, fullstack developers when we use this definition. After all, a lot of frameworks extract away the nitty-gritty parts of development, allowing us to focus on product delivery. Ironically, it is equally hard to find a developer who is unfamiliar with the stack that is not their specialization.

### The perks and costs of being a fullstack developer

Aspiring fullstack developers should understand that the title is almost an oxymoron in today's development. It is much more sensible to aim towards being a well-rounded developer. With time, and by extension experience, developers end up acquiring knowledge on how the other side works. However, developers with enough knowledge to dive on both stacks are in more demand as far as the web development is concerned. They might not have similar knowledge in the front-end compared to a front-end developer, but they are comfortable enough to deliver a final product. And in most cases, that is good enough.

#### Perks of a fullstack developer

As stated already, fullstack developers enjoy a lot more opportunities compared to a developer specializing in one stack. Most companies would prefer dealing with someone comfortable dealing with CSS edge-cases as they are dealing with odd database queries.

Software tend to become a lot more challenging and equally rewarding when dealing with both ends of the stack. It is much harder to be bored when you have twice as many features and bugs are work on. Keeping in mind most fullstack developers work on small teams, product ownership seems to come almost naturally. 

Some fullstack developers will go as far as having two different resumes, one for each stack, when applying for positions. In a way this maximizes their chances of a getting the gig. It might be tricky to some considering most fullstack developers tend to have a preferable stack when applying for positions.

#### Costs of a fullstack developer

Fullstack development means dealing with context switching on a daily basis. The mentality of front-end development is not the same as that of a back-end development. This often leads to [introduction of bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/4oki3a/a_full_stack_developer_is_a_developer_who_can/). It is almost unavoidable when the job involves working with technologies with different priorities. With Node.js, it might reduce some programming language syntax errors, as far as context switching is concerned, but the different environment requirements are still there.

A lot of software development involves keeping up to date with the [latest frameworks](http://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/) and techniques. To a fullstack developer, this means double the amount work for their immediate stack. That does not include picking up new stacks altogether.

Compared to front-end development, back-end developers have a significantly wider choice in technologies. A fullstack developer tends to be experienced in only a couple of technologies. The task of mastering several programming languages becomes harder with front-end development in mind. While they might be able to apply to several positions, it becomes harder to standout when job opportunities demand highly specific domain knowledge[^3].

There are large tech companies will outright not hire a fullstack developer. They require specific domain knowledge and would prefer someone with enough experience dealing with edge cases. Statistically, these jobs are less common but tend to be more on the bleeding edge of software development.


### Final Thoughts

The old definition of a fullstack developer is almost extinct. It is much better to refer to them as generalist developers. And the best way to become one is by focusing on one stack early in your career and while slowly picking up knowledge on the other stack. It is almost futile to aspire mastering both stacks. The amount of information grows exponentially with each additional stack.

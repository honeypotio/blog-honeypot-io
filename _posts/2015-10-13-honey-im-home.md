Hello! Welcome to our first Honeypot blog post. We launched the platform last Thursday to some very nice press from the likes of [TechCrunch][3]{:target="_blank"}, [VentureBeat][4]{:target="_blank"} and [Gruenderszene][5]{:target="_blank"}. We have also had great feedback from the 400+ new users who signed up in the first week.

So now that we have launched it's time to ask what is Honeypot all about?

### We believe IT recruitment isn’t working for anyone
We started Honeypot because IT recruitment in its current state is broken. Companies spend countless, frustrated hours reaching out to developers. Developers, on the other hand, are overloaded with mismatched offers – wrong technology, incorrect location, boring product...the list is endless.

### So, first we bring the right people together...
In building Honeypot we created a place to connect developers and companies. All developers on the platform are accepted after a code review or code challenge. Companies are also screened for quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as funding, company culture, and location, before they are allowed to use Honeypot. So, developers and companies together,  good start.

### ....and then we ask them to tell each other what they want
Next step was to increase transparency. On Honeypot developers build a profile to specify their ideal position. Companies filter for talent through location and tech requirements and then send job offers with all this information upfront. Before accepting an interview, developers can explore the product, the tech stack and the team through company profiles.

### What’s next for Honeypot?

* *Batches start:* Honeypot works on a batch-basis, meaning new developers profiles are released in groups.  We have already released our first batch. The next one will be on the 26th of October.
* *Expanding talent base:* Currently we have developers from Germany, Austria, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Ireland, Brazil, and India, among other countries. The list is growing and we are excited!
* *Developing new features:* We are continuously rolling out new features for the platform and improving ones we already have in place.

Exciting times ahead! Remember if you aren’t already onboard with Honeypot you can request an invite as a [developer][6]{:target="_blank"} or a [company][7]{:target="_blank"}.  And if you are already a user, we would love to hear your feedback so send us an email to [hello@honeypot.io][2].

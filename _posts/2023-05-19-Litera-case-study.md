## The challenge

### Busy schedule

Jelle juggles multiple roles, including software engineer, team manager, hiring manager, and tech recruiter, leaving him with little time for sourcing and hiring.

### Low inbounds quality

Jelle tried posting job openings on a popular job platform. He remembers the experience with slight agony. Out of 130 applications, only 2 were relevant, causing him to waste valuable time.

<p align="center"><img alt="Quote: Posting a job ad was close to horrible for us. 95% of the CVs that I had to read through were simply irrelevannt. That ate up my time." src="/assets/images/litera-clocktimizer-jelle-quote-2.png" style="width:400px !important;"></p><br>  

## The solution

### Convenient sourcing process

With Honeypot, Jelle needs only 15 minutes each week to source candidates. Because all talents on Honeypot are actively searching for work, Jelle is able to focus on finding candidates who fit his key criteria such as location, salary range, and necessary and desirable skills. ‘Honeypot is really convenient,’ he says. ‘You practically lay out the offer before you send an interview invite.’

This enables him to skip the first rounds of interviews, reducing his hiring journey from 3 months to 3 weeks.

### Jelle on reasons why the best candidates come from Honeypot

“We like to say 'The best people come from Honeypot!' When people ask why that is, we respond: 'We were hired through Honeypot, so that says enough, doesn't it?'.

But in all seriousness, I've seen both sides of the Honeypot platform and always had a great experience with it. I highly recommend it.”

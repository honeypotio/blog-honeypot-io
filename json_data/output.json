We launched the platform last Thursday to some very nice press from the likes of <a target='_blank' href='http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/honeypot-wants-to-be-berlins-hired' title='Honeypot Wants To Be Berlin’s Hired'>TechCrunch</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/01/berlins-honeypot' title='Honeypot tries novel way to recruit skilled developers'>VentureBeat</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/honeypot-kaya-taner-applift' title='Das neue Startup des AppLift-Gründers will das IT-Recruiting umkrempeln'>Gruenderszene</a>. We have also had great feedback from the 400+ new users who signed up in the first week.</p><p>So now that we have launched, it&#39;s time to ask what is Honeypot all about?</p><h3 id='we-believe-it-recruitment-isnt-working-for-anyone'>We believe IT recruitment isn’t working for anyone</h3><p>We started Honeypot because IT recruitment in its current state is broken. Companies spend countless, frustrated hours reaching out to developers. Developers, on the other hand, are overloaded with mismatched offers – wrong technology, incorrect location, boring product...the list is endless.</p><h3 id='so-first-we-bring-the-right-people-together'>So, first we bring the right people together...</h3><p>In building Honeypot we created a place to connect developers and companies. All developers on the platform are accepted after a code review or code challenge. Companies are also screened for quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as funding, company culture, and location, before they are allowed to use Honeypot. So, developers and companies together,  good start.</p><h3 id='and-then-we-ask-them-to-tell-each-other-what-they-want'>....and then we ask them to tell each other what they want</h3><p>Next step was to increase transparency. On Honeypot developers build a profile to specify their ideal position. Companies filter for talent through location and tech requirements and then send job offers with all this information upfront. Before accepting an interview, developers can explore the product, the tech stack and the team through company profiles.</p><h3 id='whats-next-for-honeypot'>What’s next for Honeypot?</h3><ul><li><em>Batches start:</em> Honeypot works on a batch-basis, meaning new developers profiles are released in groups.  We have already released our first batch. The next one will be on the 26th of October.</li><li><em>Expanding talent base:</em> Currently we have developers from Germany, Austria, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Ireland, Brazil, and India, among other countries. The list is growing and we are excited!</li><li><em>Developing new features:</em> We are continuously rolling out new features for the platform and improving ones we already have in place.</li></ul><p>Exciting times ahead!

      "contents": "<p>Hiring developers is hard. Really hard.  And it&#39;s hard for many reasons. It&#39;s not just  the scarcity of good developers that&#39;s challenging, it&#39;s also the difficulty of understanding their skills, judging their code, measuring cultural fit, and on and on it goes.</p><p>Honeypot was founded with all this in mind. We have been through all that pain and want to make the process of hiring the perfect developer a little easier for all sides. So here’s the five ways we are making hiring developers more efficient:</p><ol><li><p><strong>How can you understand when a developer’s code is good or bad?</strong></p><p><strong>Solution: The developer’s code is checked before they join Honeypot</strong></p><p>Judging a developer’s code for non-technical people is always a challenge. But before a developer gets accepted to Honeypot, they submit a code sample or take a code challenge. We check the way code is organised and tested, the readme, the size of methods, use of concepts like singletons, global variable classes and lots of other small stuff. Knowing that all the developers on Honeypot can code makes the whole process just that little bit easier.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you know if a developer is actively looking for a new position or not?</strong></p><p><strong>Solution: Filter for candidates by technologies, location, years of experience – and earliest start date!</strong></p><p>Developers are released onto the platform in groups, known as batches. We use batches to avoid the problem of a dead database. This means lots of fresh faces; to be part of the batch the developer has to be actively looking for a new role.  Easy-peasy!</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you judge what motivates a developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Solution: Know the candidate&#39;s ideal position through their personal profile</strong></p><p>This is a valuable feature. We don’t just let developers describe what they have done but also what they would ideally do. Knowing a candidate&#39;s preferences for technologies lets you plan for the future and think about where to fit them in as your grow and develop.</p><p>Oh, and isn’t it just better for everyone involved with salary demands are laid out from the start!</p></li><li><p><strong>How can I speed up the recruitment process of developers?</strong></p><p><strong>Solution: Contact any candidate directly through an Interview Invite</strong></p><p>The developers whose profiles are live on the site are those who are actively looking for jobs. This cuts out the annoying hit and miss of direct sourcing. The interview invite is your opportunity to contact developers directly. Act quick to get there before other companies.</p></li><li><p><strong>How can I convince a developer that we are a cool company?</strong></p><p><strong>Solution: Present your company in Company Profiles feature</strong></p><p>We will automatically create a company profile for you from the assets you provide.  The more complete the profile the higher the chance of hiring the developer.</p></li></ol><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/for_employers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=g&amp;utm_content=151002&amp;utm_campaign=hr-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and connect with top, pre-screened developers.

In this post, we chat to Fabio, one of Honeypot’s hardworking Talent Reps to figure it all out.</p><p><strong>Ok, first things first, what exactly is a batch?</strong></p><p>A batch is a group of thirty plus developer profiles which become visible to hiring companies at the same time. We release a batch every two weeks and they are largely composed of new profiles.</p><p><strong>If a developer is in a batch is their profile visible to companies?</strong></p><p>Yes, exactly! Before entry into a batch and after exit from a batch, your profile on Honeypot is invisible.  During the batch, when your profile is visible, companies can send you interview invites for job roles. Within the invites, the salary will be mentioned and the role will be described. You can accept or reject these invites.</p><p><strong>How can a developer get into a batch?</strong></p><p>First you need to  request an invite to [join] <a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=151003&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>1</a> Honeypot. We do a quick interview - maybe you’ll end up talking to me! And then we check code samples.  Once the minimum screening requirements are met you are ready to be entered into a batch and we will inform you of the date.</p><p><strong>How do you decide which profiles to include in a batch?</strong></p><p>We look at the earliest start date of the developer. Even if a developer has to fulfill a minimum contract time, it can still be a good idea to enter a batch two to three months ahead. We then try to match the skills and ideal position of the developers to the skills that the companies are looking for.</p><p><strong>Can a developer change or add some info to their profile once the batch is active?</strong></p><p>Yes, just click edit profile and add whatever information is relevant there. But it&#39;s much better to have it all ready beforehand!</p><p><strong>Why is the job hunt organized in batches?</strong></p><p>This is the most efficient way to organize the search. By releasing new profiles every two weeks, companies have an incentive to be quick to contact developers with job offers.  We are proud to count some of Berlin’s coolest startups as our clients. They use Honeypot because there is a constant in-flow of new talent.</p><p><strong>Can a developer be included in two or more concurrent batches?</strong></p><p>Yes in some cases they can. This would happen when there is a large number of companies looking for that particular skillset.</p><p><strong>Will there be tweaks to the system in the future?</strong></p><p>Yes, we will be tweaking the way the batches are organized, the frequency of release and the number of profiles visible, for example. We are constantly getting feedback from users and from companies about what works best. If you have any feedback, feel free to [write] <a target='_blank' href='mailto:fabio@honeypot.io' title='Hello Fabio'>2</a> to me.</p><p><strong>Anything else to add?</strong></p><p>Oh yes! We add a headline to developer profiles before they go live in the batch. This is a 70-character summary highlighting key skills and experience which should give you better chances of finding your ideal position. Keep an eye on your emails because we will send it out for your feedback a couple of days prior!</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=151003&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>Salary is one of the biggest taboo topics in work environments. Developers, like other employees, want to know whether they&#39;re getting paid well enough, how they rank compared to their peers, and whether they could be getting more somewhere else. Yet, people have a hard time asking for a raise – in fact, “how to ask for a raise” is one of the highest ranking “how to” questions on Google.</p><p>The war for talented developers is no secret. According to the European Commission, the current shortage of coding ability in Europe could result in a deficit of up to 900,000 ICT professionals by 2020. But when looking at compensation, it’s important to appreciate it as a whole. Some companies reward in more than just the salary - with prestige, equity or benefits. The following are some tips which will give clarity to your renegotiations.</p><p><strong>Understand how the market determines salaries</strong></p><p>There is no global definition for how much each person is worth, but there are ways to learn the market. In any given time there are global trends that influence what filling a specific position is worth for a company. Factors to consider include:</p><p>•    Geographic location and the cost of living there</p><p>•    The demand for your skillset and the number of people to fill it</p><p>•    Tech trends, such as the popularity of new technologies</p><p>When looking for an average salary in your region you can use websites such as [Glassdoor] <a target='_blank' href='http://www.glassdoor.com'>1</a>, [Payscale] <a target='_blank' href='http://www.payscale.com'>2</a> or through specific [developer calculators] <a target='_blank' href='http://www.whatamiworth.io' title='developer salary calculator'>3</a>.</p><p><strong>Use the tools of a HR-manager</strong></p><p>It may come as a surprise to an employee that HR professionals can face the same struggles when defining a budget for the position. There are tools that exist for this matter, and as a talent you&#39;ll need to think like a recruiter in order to know your worth. It’s very common for companies to subscribe to services that give their HR department access to average salaries for many positions, and any HR manager from your industry could help in understanding your worth. It can help to gain access to HR-oriented salary surveys – if you aren’t a HR manager yourself, try and ask one. This is especially true as companies rely on the same surveys to budget for positions.</p><p><strong>Review job boards for similar positions</strong></p><p>Tech trends shift every day and if you’re reading blogs and following the news you should already be aware of most. By reviewing job boards periodically you could also get a feel for the demand in different areas. Also try tools such as Google Trends to keep an eye on the rise and fall of your favorite technology.</p><p><strong>Understand that titles do matter</strong></p><p>In many cases your title will not fully explain what you do; general titles such as &quot;Architect&quot; or &quot;Software Engineer&quot; might not fully cover it. Be sure to learn what title is the most accurate for your job. Establishing your title will allow you to better focus your salary research and tailor your online profile and CV.</p><p><strong>Break down your tasks to reflect your title</strong></p><p>Sometimes you&#39;ll you do more than just one thing. This is especially true with smaller start-ups and companies that encourage initiative. When you don&#39;t fit one title I have found that the best way to define yourself is to break it down.</p><p>Let&#39;s say that you&#39;re a Support Engineer, but you also spend some time developing tools and writing code, performing some professional services when it&#39;s needed. It would be a shame to avoid including this into your salary calculations, so assuming development takes about 15-20% of your time, just add this to an average. Your salary could be defined as 80% the average of a Support Engineer plus the 20% of a developer. Your CV should reflect both aspects as well. By breaking it down you can not only explain your worth to yourself, but also to your manager when you&#39;ll be asking for a raise.</p><p><strong>Come prepared to the negotiation table</strong></p><p>Each company has their own mentality and principles, and some will have a policy of not changing salaries mid-year. This doesn&#39;t mean that you should wait long months to discuss your salary. The key to raising the topic is doing a lot of preparation work. You will want to argue that you are worth what you&#39;re asking for - naturally this puts pleading or threatening out of the question.</p><p>•    Set a one-on-one meeting with your manager</p><p>•    Present all the good work you&#39;ve been doing</p><p>•    Support this by explaining that your salary should reflect all aspects of your work</p><p>•    Don&#39;t be afraid to support this with numbers</p><p><strong>Stay active with new opportunities</strong></p><p>Always stay aware of what you&#39;re worth. Even if you are not actively looking - it&#39;s good to periodically open your ears to job offers and advancement opportunities. Apply to a couple of places if you see your &quot;dream job&quot; coming up - by staying active and out there you&#39;ll always be updated with hiring trends, and most importantly, if it gets to a point where you get an offer from another company, you&#39;ll know exactly what you&#39;re worth. This is the best position to be in when negotiating your salary. When someone else offers to pay you more, it will take most of the sting out of discussing a raise, and will give your company incentive to match the offer.</p><p><strong>Take care of your salary and put the topic aside</strong></p><p>Ironically, the bottom line is that there are other things that are equally or more important than your salary at work. This is exactly why it&#39;s important to take care of your salary and put the topic aside. It takes only half an hour to formulate your work and figure out your average pay. It would take another couple of hours every year to maintain your CV and keep an eye out for advancement opportunities. Invest this time so that you&#39;ll be free to focus on what really matters - being good, staying happy and sharp, and doing awesome work with wonderful people.</p><p><strong><em>Read more from Eyal on his [blog] <a target='_blank' href='http://matzkelon.com/'>5</a> or check out his profile on [LinkedIn] <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ematzkel'>6</a>.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>If you are interested in what you could earn as a developer in Berlin, try out Honeypot&#39;s [developer calculator] <a target='_blank' href='http://www.whatamiworth.io' title='developer salary calculator'>4</a>.</em></strong></p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=151101&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>My girlfriend and I recently moved to Berlin. Given my German citizenship and extensive stay in the U.S., I have had my fair share of experiences with immigration services, the countless barriers and hurdles, the ever “friendly” and “welcoming” government employees and, of course the obscene application and processing fees that would be far more usefully put towards rent, food, or even a brief get-away.</p><p>Unfortunately the German process is just as frustrating and unpleasant. But the following is a practical step-by-step guide detailing how we successfully completed the visa process, the little  little things that we encountered to be unexpectedly useful, and a few words of wisdom.</p><p><strong>1. Arrive in Germany</strong></p><p>Some good news to start - if you plan to visit Germany for less than 90 days, you can get a visa upon arrival. After this initial period, you will need to leave for another 90 days before you can come back. Of course the prerequisite for this is to (1) be in possession of a passport that is valid at least six months and (2) not be a citizen of <a target='_blank' href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32001R0539' title='Scroll to Annex 1'>these countries</a>.</p><p><strong>2. Find a place to stay</strong></p><p>For the less adventurous, finding a place to stay could even be considered as Step 1!There are several websites, such as <a target='_blank' href='http://wunderflats.com/'>Wunderflats</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.coming-home.org/'>Coming-Home</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.crocodilian.de/'>Crocodilian</a> where you can find accommodation in all shapes and sizes, but if you are on a budget I would strongly suggest looking through the various Facebook groups that are both more international and often times geared to short-term subletting, which in the beginning should be more than enough to settle in and get acquainted.</p><p><strong>3. 90 days to find a job</strong></p><p>Now that you found a place to stay, hit up every website you can find and look through the job postings that you are interested in. Good examples are jobspotting, monster, and start up portals like berlinstartupjobs.com, gruenderszene.de, or deutsche-startups.de. If you are a developer, look no further than <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/' title='The developer-focused job platform'>Honeypot</a>!</p><p>If you really commit to finding a job, which sometimes involves being realistic and not too picky, you should be able to find one in the 90-day period the Schengen Visa gives you. It can potentially be disheartening and humbling, but if you really want it, you gotta prove it.</p><p><strong>4.

A helpful tip is to bring your degree transcript - if you have one!</p><p>Once your number is called up, you enter the designated room and hand over the documents. The exact selection seems to vary on a case-by-case basis, so make sure you have everything from the above list. The lady or gentleman will then ask you to go back to the waiting room and after 15-20 minutes will call up your number after he/she has worked his/her government magic. Now you should have a <a target='_blank' href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Fiktionsbescheinigung-Klebeetikett.jpg' title='Example Temporary Residence Permit'>Fiktionsbescheinigung</a> (Temporary Residence Permit), which will extend your permitted stay beyond the previous 90 days granted by the Schengen visa. This is just a precautionary matter in case the visa application process takes longer than expected. At this point you will receive a card with which you will be able to pay at the Kassenautomat. There goes the first 20€ to the German government. Given the Germans’ knack for being timely, sometimes your number will actually be called up earlier than it says in your confirmation email. So, do yourself a favour and show up a good 15 minutes early - better safe than sorry.</p><p><strong>6. Wait</strong></p><p>This is the worst part of the whole process, because you can’t really do anything to expedite it, you can’t work, and you should not really leave the country. This last point is more of a cautionary measure to avoid any potential problems at the border when returning to Germany.</p><p>Three weeks after you have applied for your visa you can check in with the Arbeitsagentur folks in Bonn and give them a buzz on +49(0)228-7131313. Fair warning - all they can do is give you a status update and maybe an estimate of when you can expect that email, so don’t expect too much.</p><p><strong>7.Pick up your visa</strong></p><p>You just got the confirmation email that your application has been approved, congratulations! You’re almost there. Just one more easy step. Now, you have to go back to the Ausländerbehörde (from Step 6) and go to the same area you were in before.</p><p>This time you will not have a predetermined number, so you will have to wait in line to get one. In Berlin, for American citizens and most African nationals, this is on the second floor of Haus C at the very end of the green corridor of Sektor 6. If you don’t see anyone waiting, knock on one of the two doors (one in each of the waiting areas) and see if they are currently occupied. For other nationalities, just refer to the receptionist as to where you have to go. The process is still the same.</p><p>Here you present your confirmation email and the necessary documents - only your passport, unless otherwise noted - you receive your final waiting ticket and once your number is called up, you will be able to pick up your passport, which is now sporting your newly approved working visa!</p><p>To complete the process, you will receive another card with which you will need to pay the final balance of 60€.</p><p><strong>8. Willkommen!</strong></p><p>Have a Bier, revel in your newly approved working authorisation, and then get to work! ;)</p>",

Spotify uses phrases like “tribe” and “squad” and “alliance”.  Our first question has to be does Spotify just not like the word “team”?</h3><p>Ha! I get asked this question a lot actually. We choose these different names because any individual can be a member of multiple teams (at minimum they are a member of a squad, chapter, tribe and guild) and it all depends on the context. Honestly, we had to create these new words to be able to talk to each other.</p><h3 id='if-a-new-developer-would-join-spotify-what-type-of-team-would-they-join'>If a new developer would join Spotify, what type of team would they join?</h3><p>They would likely join a squad. A squad is an autonomous, full-stack team composed of six to twelve people, usually containing a Product Owner, UX, iOS, K&amp;M [keyboard and mouse], QA, Android, Backend, and a Scrum Coach. <strong>Squads are essentially Spotify’s mini-start-ups with full responsibility for a single feature or component</strong>, and Scrum teams have full power to make decisions. This is the fundamental unit of Spotify’s organizational structure and is designed to optimize autonomy.</p><h3 id='so-squads-are-designed-to-give-team-members-autonomy-how-is-this-implemented-logistically-in-terms-of-office-space-and-design'>So squads are designed to give team members autonomy. How is this implemented logistically, in terms of office space and design?</h3><p>Squads are housed in squad rooms with 12 desks, a chill-out area and a meeting room.</p><h3 id='how-is-work-divided-between-squads'>How is work divided between squads?</h3><p>A squad is started to fulfil a particular mission. Missions can be open- or closed-ended. Search for example is an open-ended mission. In the case of a close-ended mission, to upgrade a feature for instance, squads dissolve once the mission is complete. Teams aren’t dependent on other teams. They don’t need to coordinate with anyone else to get their job done, so they are continually innovating.</p><h3 id='who-is-responsible-for-the-squad'>Who is responsible for the squad?</h3><p>The squad is collectively responsible. Larger organizations who are attempting to implement the Spotify model often overlook this point: individually accountable, collectively responsible. </p><h3 id='does-spotify-have-managers'>Does Spotify have managers?</h3><p>This is another common misperception. <strong>Spotify does have managers, it’s just a different perspective.</strong> Instead of having team managers, we have line managers, which we call Chapter Leads. They look after all those people with the same skillset across the squads. For example, I might be the Chapter Lead for all Android developers. The cool thing is Chapter Leads are part-time developers, they usually sit on one of the squads themselves.</p><h3 id='what-are-the-benefits-of-this-vertical-leadership'>What are the benefits of this vertical leadership?</h3><p><strong>Your boss is doing the same job as you, that’s a huge benefit. They can understand what you are doing day to day.</strong> The Chapter Lead also has visibility into a number of teams and can facilitate movement of people which makes the organizational structure very dynamic. Your chapter becomes your home and your boss stays your boss and your peers stay your peers no matter which squad you are on.</p><h3 id='how-does-the-tribe-connect-to-the-squad'>How does the tribe connect to the squad?</h3><p>Spotify’s engineering and product organization is split into several large groups, called tribes. Multiple squads form a tribe. And Tribe Leads are the first level of full time management. The ideal size of a tribe is 40 to 150 people; 40 keeps the tribe fluid and allows for movement between squads and 150 is when you start to reach Dunbar&#39;s number.  Each Tribe has responsibility for a particular set of related features or engineering functions and is designed to encourage independent workflow and autonomy, cut decision-making bottlenecks and improve the speed at which decisions can be taken, all while keeping teams cross-functional with fluid communication.</p><h3 id='how-many-tribes-are-there-and-what-are-some-examples-of-how-they-are-divided'>How many tribes are there and what are some examples of how they are divided?</h3><p>There are currently twelve tribes. In my organization, there are three tribes: one tribe is focused on satisfying high-intent use cases, like running and user curation. One tribe is focused on low-intent use cases, and another on product strategy. The last tribe handles the media path from ingestion from our media licensors through to playback on local devices.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/spotifygraphic.png' alt='graphic'></p><h3 id='how-do-you-encourage-communication-between-tribes'>How do you encourage communication between tribes?</h3><p>We have guilds, these are voluntary groups which span the entire organization. Anyone can create a guild and membership is optional. We have very work specific guilds – the Java guild, the C++ guild, the Android guild. Then we have more fun guilds, like the craft-brewery guild, the photography guild. So there is both structured and unstructured guilds and they meet regularly.</p><h3 id='lets-talk-a-little-about-you-before-you-joined-spotify-you-had-some-experience-with-big-companies-like-microsoft-and-adobe-what-attracted-you-to-spotify'>Let’s talk a little about you. Before you joined Spotify, you had some experience with big companies, like Microsoft and Adobe. What attracted you to Spotify?</h3><p>The funny thing was the senior leaders at Spotify approached me because they wanted some big company experience. <strong>And I liked them for everything that set them apart from big-company culture.</strong> When they sent me over the documents about the model something clicked for me. This is what I had been working towards and trying to implement at Adobe. But at Spotify it was fully realized. My first question was does it really work this way? When I visited Stockholm, I immediately saw that yes it does work this way.</p><h3 id='you-joined-microsoft-in-1994-what-were-you-doing-there-and-how-would-you-describe-the-company-culture'>You joined Microsoft in 1994. What were you doing there and how would you describe the company culture?</h3><p>I joined as a software design engineer.  I worked on a number of different products there but in my final role I was working as part of the Windows Media version 7.0 application team in the Digital Media Division. <strong>At that time Microsoft were famous for their competitive engineering culture. In fact, they were quite proud of it.</strong> To move into management, you were expected to embrace that. I guess it didn’t suit my style of working. By the time I was leaving I was definitely ready for something very different.</p><h3 id='after-a-couple-of-years-with-some-start-ups-and-a-brief-return-to-microsoft-you-joined-adobe-did-the-culture-there-differ-from-microsoft'>After a couple of years with some start-ups and a brief return to Microsoft, you joined Adobe. Did the culture there differ from Microsoft?</h3><p>I joined Adobe in 2004 and stayed for 9 years. Adobe had a different feeling for sure. The company was already working in an agile way. They were trying out new ideas. But this only existed at certain levels of the company; as I moved through the hierarchy and began to interact with different parts of the organizational structure it became clear that this way of thinking was not true for the entire organization. I reverted back to the mode of singular change agent and I began to feel trapped.</p><h3 id='what-does-the-culture-at-microsoft-or-adobe-differ-from-spotify'>What does the culture at Microsoft or Adobe differ from Spotify</h3><p>The way Spotify works is not fixed, unlike Microsoft. When I joined Microsoft the company had 18,000 people, when I left it had 60,000. But nothing much had changed during that time, the company still operated in the same way. I felt a similar thing after nine years at Adobe. Of course at Microsoft there was always some interest in finding better ways to work but these were always individually-led initiatives. At Spotify, culture is a constant source of debate. Organizational thinking permeates the whole organization, it’s not just aspirational or some HR-initiative. The feeling of finding a better ways to work is omnipresent at Spotify. I have been at Spotify for two and a half years and it feels like an organizational culture lab, we are constantly running experiments. And importantly, we are doing this while building a strong product in a competitive environment.</p><h3 id='what-doesnt-work-at-spotify'>What doesn’t work at Spotify?</h3><p>Big projects can be challenging. Especially given our model of autonomous teams.  When we changed our UI  to the new dark look. In a traditional organization it would have taken a few weeks. It took us three months and we had to pull a bunch of our developers out of normal team structures. Very un-Spotify.</p><h3 id='what-is-your-attitude-towards-failure'>What is your attitude towards failure?</h3><p><strong>Failure is part of the life of a continuous improvement organization.</strong> Failure is punished at big corporations. They want to be innovative but this attitude forces staff to play it safe. One of my favourite quotes is from the film director Kevin Smith, “Failure is success practice.” I really believe that.</p><h3 id='this-whole-spotify-structure-seems-a-bit-chaotic-for-a-manager-how-is-it-for-you'>This whole Spotify structure seems a bit chaotic for a manager. How is it for you?</h3><p>I just have to trust we hired the right people. I have to make sure they have everything they need to make good decisions. Teams don’t need to tell me about changes. They make those decisions. This chaos works for us, mostly.</p><h3 id='what-is-your-ultimate-goal-with-this-model'>What is your ultimate goal with this model?</h3><p><strong>We want people to be happy, to build careers at Spotify, to have a sense of ownership over what they do.</strong> We want the model to be adaptable and to encourage continuous improvement.</p><h3 id='what-companies-do-you-admire'>What companies do you admire?</h3><p>I admire <a target='_blank' href='https://automattic.com/'>Automattic</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/'>Medium</a>. All those companies are doing interesting things. But of course, they are also small. It’s hard to imagine them scaling, but I would be intrigued to see what they do. I also think that Zappo’s leadership structure is interesting. I don’t think this could apply to us, but it is interesting none the less in terms of organizational culture.</p><h3 id='what-books-can-you-recommend-about-company-culture'>What books can you recommend about company culture?</h3><p>Daniel Pink’s <a target='_blank' href='http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805' title='Drive'>“Drive”</a> is a good read.

We are also using NoSQL <a target='_blank' href='http://www.networkworld.com/article/2932313/cloud-computing/how-amazon-s-dynamodb-helped-reinvent-databases.html' title='How DynamoDB helped reinvent databases'>DynamoDB</a>. For categorization, we have natural language processing using Python and for machine learning we are using the services of AWS. For event processing we are using <a target='_blank' href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/Welcome.html' title='SQS Developer Guide'>SQS</a>, also from AWS.</p><p><strong>Is it challenging to attract developers to FinTech?</strong></p><p>FinTech is a very hot industry at the moment. You can really have an impact as a developer. For us it&#39;s not easy to find the right people, as we set our standards very high. We are on the lookout for people who like our product. This is central to our success - to have a team of people who really like what the company does. When you are developing for yourself, it&#39;s a lot more fun.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest technical challenges you face?</strong></p><p>Leveraging technology and data to create a smarter banking system. Besides linking authorization, we are also working on developing contextual information. Imagine, for example, you have a trip to Prague - you want to have an overview of your spending and also to have the opportunity to compare this to previous trips. This is the kind of contextual information we are working on in order to improve the user experience.</p><p><strong>How fast can you implement new ideas?</strong></p><p>Recently a developer came up with the idea of 3D touch, similar to what we have seen on the iPhone. We looked into it and it took us two days to get into production and live for the user. So we can be really fast.</p><p><strong>How does Number26 guarantee security for the user?</strong></p><p>Security and data privacy are essential to us. Because we are digital, we believe we can protect data better than others. Take money transfers for example. There are three levels of security. First, you open the app with fingerprint or username and password. Second, you enter your pin. Finally, an encrypted push notification (as opposed to a more traditional SMS TAN) is sent and can only be confirmed by your phone.  If you lose one of those three items you can&#39;t make a transaction. It&#39;s more secure than most banks. Security is very important to us - for me as CTO, I want to be able to sleep well at night!</p><p><strong>Traditional banks are built around branches. Number26 disrupts this. Do you envisage this movement away from branches as becoming standard for banking?</strong></p><p>Every year there are fewer and fewer interactions with branches and clerks, and more and more branches are closing, so definitely there is a trend that people do things more online - and even on mobile. Our customers are very happy that they can do things conveniently by mobile but what we see is that people still want a physical place to deposit cash. Cash, especially in Germany, is still very important. We introduced Cash26, a feature that allows you to deposit or withdraw cash in supermarkets. We are offering what our clients asked for not by relying on old banking infrastructures but by rethinking the experience completely.</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/the_rise_of_the_digital_bank' title='McKinsey Digital Banking Report'>McKinsey</a> recently reported that 90% European banks are investing as little as 0.5% of their total spending on digital. Are you surprised that they aren’t investing more?</strong></p><p>I think they are moving as aggressively as they can, but as a big organization it&#39;s not easy to change. They have a legacy - they have these branches, decades-old hierarchies and the costs that are connected to these elements. We don&#39;t have that, so for us it&#39;s much easier and quicker to move. They will digitalize and try their very best.</p><p><strong>Are you surprised by the success of Number26 in Germany, given the traditional suspicion of German people to technology?</strong></p><p>I am surprised on one hand, but we get the feedback that it is long overdue. Yes we are excited, yes we are surprised, but really, it&#39;s also understandable. After all, the premise for our product was that people are unhappy with the way banking works today.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for future growth?</strong></p><p>We launch the overdraft feature on December 1st. The next thing is Maestro card.Then we are looking into smart banking. It&#39;s a very exciting time, because change can come within a couple of weeks, rather than a couple of years.</p><p><strong>Thanks Christian!</strong></p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='7'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p><a target='_blank' href='https://mail.Ru' title='mail.Ru homepage'>Mail.Ru</a> launched in 1998 and today is the largest email service in Russia. As of October 2015, it had 62.6 million monthly users. The email service delivers 600 million messages per day and has a data storage of over 30 petabytes. At <a target='_blank' href='http://highload.co/' title='Highload Conference'>Highload 2015</a>, we sat down and chatted to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-anikin-b3898526' title='Dennis Anikin'>Dennis Anikin</a>, the Director of Engineering of Cloud and Email Service. He told us about Mail.Ru&#39;s plans to migrate their email service and the advantages of Tarnatool, their open-source NoSQL database management system.</p><p><strong>What experience do you have with mail systems and cloud storage?</strong></p><p>I’ve been doing email services all my life pretty much.  Before Mail.Ru, I worked for Yandex and RBC, both in email services.  Now I’m the Director of Engineering of Cloud and Email Service at Mail.Ru. It&#39;s the sixth largest email service in the world.</p><p><strong>What is the team setup like at Mail.Ru?</strong></p><p>In my team, we are about 70 people, the majority of whom are software engineers and engineering managers. The team also includes quality engineers and security engineers.</p><p><strong>How is the Mail.Ru team organized?</strong></p><p>We are organized into small teams, each having a team lead reporting to a manager, who operates across teams. Managers are tasked with a particular duty and must use multi-team resources to complete that. The software engineering teams are full-stack but there are role-specific teams, such as quality assurance and security.</p><p><strong>How do you motivate your team?</strong></p><p>People can lose motivation if they don’t see how their work fits into the larger goals of the company. I try to develop my people in line with making our services faster and more stable.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the tech stack of Mail.Ru email service?</strong></p><p>Email service is a very complicated thing! The user’s browser is HTML and Javascript. Directly under this is Perl, Python, Go, C and C++. For the mission critical tasks we are using C and C++. We process requests from the message list, the main page on email, through our custom web-server. For the majority of the less-demanding pages, we are using Apache plus Perl. For mission critical things inside Perl, we are using C++ through <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_%28Perl%29' title='What is XS?'>XS</a>. Our message storage is all home-written. It is divided into three separate pieces, one piece is for storage of big files, another piece is meta-information and the third thing in the storage layer is a full text search engine. We have a search engine inside our email service. This search engine is also self-written.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/mailru.png' alt='mail.ru group structure'></p><p><strong>Tarantool is Mail.Ru’s open-source NoSQL database management system. Can you tell us some history of the project?</strong></p><p>Tarantool is an in-memory database. The project started as a graph database for one of our social networks.  With time it began to develop. We can’t widely use other databases such as MySQL, because we need a system which works fast and has a low total cost of ownership.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Tarantool?</strong></p><p>It is faster than most other in-memory databases. Tarantool is a real database with transactions, replication and stored procedures. We’ve also run tests to compare it with Couchbase and Redis – the results are available <a target='_blank' href='http://articles.rvncerr.org/how-to-chose-an-in-memory-nosql-solution-performance-measuring/' title='Tarantool Comparison'>online</a>.  Today there are many companies using Tarantool, but it&#39;s still not too well-known since we have not advertised it yet.</p><p><strong>Tarantool was built by just 10 engineers. How is it faster than MySQL, when so many more engineers were involved?</strong></p><p>Many other database vendors are focused on features, but we are focused on performance. We are very passionate about optimization and we try to get every last drop of performance out of servers.</p><p><strong>Aside from Tarantool, do you have any other open source projects?</strong></p><p>We have some open source projects listed on the open source section of our <a target='_blank' href='http://opensource.mail.ru/'>wesbite</a>. The most important one is <a target='_blank' href='http://maps.me/en/home'>maps.me</a>. It’s one of the biggest mobile map applications in the world. In coordination with OSM, a project dedicated to providing crowdsourced mapped data of the world, opening maps.me’s source code became an important step in changing the ecosystem of the development of mapping apps.</p><p><strong>What is the total storage size of your cloud and email services?</strong></p><p>Our cloud and email service is 30 petabytes each, so altogether they are 60 petabytes of information.</p><p><strong>You are currently trying to migrate your email storage. How and why?</strong></p><p>Our current email storage needs to be more efficient. It consists of big attachments, which we partially store on machines with 16 disks with 2 terabytes of storage each.  We need to move it to 24 by 4 terabyte disks. This move could save us millions of dollars and make our system much faster. For our email and cloud storage, we are not using SSD discs. We are using normal spinning discs. They are 10 times cheaper than SSD. Even for meta-information we are not using SSD. The main advantage of magnetic is price – this is what makes our cloud service so affordable.</p><p><strong>What do you think Mail.Ru does better than Gmail?</strong>I think speed, efficiency and uptime are our key strengths. It’s difficult to compare interfaces and user experience formally but most Russians prefer Mail.Ru. We are six times bigger than Gmail in Russia in terms of the monthly audience. That is some indication for us about the success of our product.</p><p><strong>From where do you recruit your developers?</strong></p><p>The main source of talent for us is new grads from universities. We have special teaching programs with three Moscow universities, to both attract students to the Mail.Ru Group and to guarantee a high quality of new hires.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between American developers and Russian developers in your opinion?</strong></p><p>It’s my belief that Russians have higher tolerance for risk than Westerners. And with that comes speed of implementation. For example, if you need to do something fast – if your deadline is yesterday – a Russian will say “no problem at all, I will do it right now.” A western guy would rather rely on standard rules and procedures even if it results in missing the deadline. A Russian guy always finds a very creative way to meet even the tightest deadline, to get the job done fast and with necessary level of quality and to satisfy all the mission-impossible requirements.</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=151107&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>Relocating to another country is scary and complicated.  Amongst all those cultural clashes, one of the biggest comforts is help and advice from fellow countrymen. As a Russian-speaker myself and a (fairly) recent arrival in Berlin, this post is designed as a guide to the Russian-speaking IT-community in the German capital.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Russians are a majority minority:</strong> Berlin is a city of contrast, where the east and west collide to form a unique culture, but what makes the city truely different from the rest of Germany is its diversity.  Berlin is a city of immigrants. There are more than 600,000 non-Germans from more than 190 countries living here, accounting for 18% of the population. A further 30% of Berliners are first generation German, meaning their parents are immigrants. The biggest expat-communities are Polish, Turkish and Russian. According to different sources there are around 200-300,000 Russian-speaking people living in Berlin, the equivalent of a medium-sized German city.</p></li><li><p><strong>There are two options for visas</strong>: as for relocation process, you may check our recent blog posts about <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/moving-to-berlin-infographic/' title='Moving to Berlin Infographic'>moving to Berlin</a> and overcoming the bureaucracy hurdles. Typically Russian-speaking developers are eligible for the single residence visa and the <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/EU-Bluecard-for-software-developers/' title='Blue Card Infographic'>EU Blue Card visa</a>. Companies usually help, assisting with all the necessary documents for the visa and in some cases providing relocation bonuses and/or travel coverage.</p></li><li><p><strong>You can eat all the pelmeni and borsch you desire:</strong> If you are missing home comforts, there are plenty of Russian supermarkets. Two of my favourites are <a target='_blank' href='http://www.russia-laden.de/' title='Russia-Laden'>Russia</a> in Charlottenburg and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.stolitschniy-berlin.de/'>Intermarkt</a> in Lichtenberg.</p></li><li><p><strong>You probably have to speak English to work in a startup:</strong> With some rare exceptions, the main speaking language in Berlin’s startups is English.</p></li><li><p><strong>Berlin is cheaper than Moscow:</strong> The other thing that makes Berlin unique is its comparatively low cost of living. Prices in general are lower than Moscow. In Berlin you can get a 1-room flat in the center for €700, much more affordable than Moscow. And forget about the usual Moscow-style traffic jams and overcrowded subways: Berlin is a city of bicycles and boasts an efficient network of public transport (U-bahn and S-bahn). The population density is lower than Moscow (3,900 people/km² in Berlin vs 5,000 people/km²  in Moscow), which makes Berlin less crowded.</p></li><li><p><strong>The workplace is pretty friendly:</strong> Almost every startup in Berlin has good working conditions: nice offices with modern equipment, free fruit and drinks, regular meetups, hackathons and team events.</p></li><li><p><strong>There is a huge Russian-speaking developer community here:</strong> if you miss the Russian language, have “Heimweh” and want to discuss specific issues with Russian-speaking developers, there is a Russian IT-community in Berlin – <a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/itberlin/' title='IT-Berlin Facebook Group'>IT Berlin</a>. The group was founded in December 2014 and currently has more than 300 members on Facebook. They also  have a slack-chat. According to the founder of IT Berlin, Mikhail Kosmykov, the main reason for creating the group was lack of live communication on various IT topics. Mikahil comments, “When you move to another country, the connections with your friends and former colleagues become weaker. Our IT-group helps to find local IT people with whom you can fill this gap. We share     useful information about relocation, finding flats, changing jobs or bureaucracy issues, for instance. Experienced locals can give advice to     beginners in various domestic issues.” The meetings of IT Berlin usually take place once or twice a month in informal settings.</p></li></ol><ol start='8'><li><p><strong>You can get local news in Russian:</strong> There are some Russian journals, such as - <a target='_blank' href='http://berlin24.ru/' title='Berlin 24'>Berlin24</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.rg-rb.de/' title='RG-RB'>RG-RB</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>There&#39;s plenty of Russian entertainment too</strong> There are many activities organized by Russian-speaking community in Berlin. People gather to play Mafia almost every week, have occasional BBQ’s in summer or go ice-skating together in winter. There are a huge amount of seminars and concerts of Russian and Ukrainian bands (e.g. 5’nizza). There are clubs aimed at the Russian-speaking community (Klubnika in Friedrichshain)and Russian restaurants (such as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/goldeneperleberlin' title='Golden Perle'>Goldene Perle</a> in Lichtenberg). For the art-lovers like myself,  the <a target='_blank' href='http://panda-theater.de/home/' title='Panda Theater'>PANDA</a> theatre in Prenzlauer Berg organizes art exhibitions, Russian poetry readings and music performances.   <a target='_blank' href='http://vk.com/berlinwunderbar' title='Berlin Wunderbar'>Berlin Wunderbar</a>,  a popular group on VK, keeps track of all relevant events for Russian-speaking people in Berlin. You can also get updates on Facebook through <a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukrainiansinberlin/' title='Ukrainians in Berlin'>Ukrainians in Berlin</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/590905587627980/' title='Russians in Berlin'>Russians in Berlin</a> groups.</p></li></ol><p>So, overall, there are many perks of living in Berlin: it’s an international and tolerant city; it has active Russian-speaking communities; it’s relatively cheap and convenient; and it’s one of the most successful IT-hub of Europe. As Kirill Shirinkin, a local Russian developer put it, “Berlin is  the best city in the world. Nowhere has grabbed my attention like this city. Beautiful, diverse, big, but very cozy, international, smart public transport - and a lot of work opportunities.”</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='11'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

The key, then, is to ask questions that touch on technical issues, but also give the developer some space to express their ideas and communicate the unique elements they can bring to the role. That’s a tricky balance to strike, but we at Honeypot have helped hundreds of businesses connect with thousands of developer candidates, and in the process we’ve learned a lot about how top companies interview for frontend developer positions. In this article we lay out our 7 favorite interview questions for frontend developers, along with a higher-end summary of the topics you should touch on and the skills the candidate should demonstrate.</p><h2 id='what-skills-do-frontend-developers-need-to-demonstrate'>What Skills Do Frontend Developers Need to Demonstrate?</h2><p>Before we get to specific questions, let’s first discuss the areas of proficiency that a frontend developer must demonstrate.</p><h3 id='html-and-css'>HTML and CSS</h3><p>HTML and CSS are the bedrock of a frontend’s developer toolkit, so it’s important that the interviewer probe the candidate’s knowledge of these programming languages. You can ask specific questions about naming conventions or preprocessors, or provide a mockup for them to build into a full layout. </p><h3 id='javascript'>Javascript</h3><p>The other programming language that almost any frontend developer must be proficient in is Javascript, along with related libraries like Jquery. Many top companies devote the most substantial portion of the interview towards testing candidates on their Javascript knowledge. </p><h3 id='learning-and-adaptability'>Learning and Adaptability</h3><p>Finally, since frontend coding techniques evolve rapidly, you should ask questions that probe just how committed to learning new things the candidate is. Do they read blogs or publications with the latest frontend dev news? </p><h2 id='7-front-end-developer-interview-questions'>7 Front End Developer Interview Questions</h2><p>These questions are non-technical, so they’re designed to probe an interview candidate’s overall knowledge, creativity, and ability to think on their feet, but NOT their granular knowledge of specific areas of frontend development. These questions can form the backbone of your interview process, but they should be supplemented with technical tests of proficiency as well. </p><h3 id='1-can-you-describe-your-workflow-when-you-create-a-web-page'>1. Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?</h3><p>The workflow of a modern front-end developer has changed vastly in the past four or five years. A huge array of tools are available to build organized, scalable web applications by abstracting out many of the complexities and automating repetitive tasks. Each developer will share a different workflow which will give some insight into their organizational capacity and general technical preferences.</p><h3 id='2-if-you-arrive-at-a-new-company-that-has-3-competing-stylesheets-how-would-you-best-integrate-them-into-the-site'>2. If you arrive at a new company that has 3 competing stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?</h3><p>A stylesheet is a template file consisting of font and layout settings to give a standardized look to a website or web application. To keep a consistent look and feel to a project, there should only be one stylesheet. I like to ask this question to judge problem-solving, communication and team skills.</p><h3 id='3-have-you-ever-used-an-mvc-which-one-and-what-do-you-like-and-dislike-about-it'>3. Have you ever used an MVC? Which one and what do you like and dislike about it?</h3><p>MVC stands for model view controller. MVCs typically organize webapps into a well-structured pattern, making code easier to maintain. The term is well-known by developers and some famous examples of MVCs include backbone.js and angular.js. What makes this question interesting is not whether the frontend interviewee has used an MVC, but what his or her preferences and experience reveal. Candidates who are able to articulate why they use one MVC over another show that they are engaged in what they do, care about the technology and have considered different options. You want to be able to trust your frontend developer to keep up to date with which technologies are relevant and have a clear idea of when and what should be used.</p><h3 id='4-what-are-your-favourite-features-of-html5-and-css3-and-what-would-you-change'>4. What are your favourite features of HTML5 and CSS3 and what would you change?</h3><p>This question is similar to number 3. But rather than keeping up with new technologies, it reveals whether the front-end developer being interviewed is also up to date with new features within the core technologies.</p><h3 id='5-in-your-view-whats-the-difference-between-frontend-developers-and-uiux-designers-and-where-do-these-positions-overlap'>5. In your view, what&#39;s the difference between Frontend Developers and UI/UX designers and where do these positions overlap?</h3><p>There is no definitive answer to the question, but it will give a frontend developer the chance to evaluate their own experience and also reveal their expectations. To a certain extent the difference between UI/UX and front-end development is the difference between design and implementation. UX/UI tends to look more at the human-side of the design process, including undertaking research by asking the questions about how users interact with a website, which would then form the basis for design concepts. A UX/UI would also do testing and evaluation post-implementation. Understanding the front-end needs of your own company before asking this question gives an insight into the candidate&#39;s potential fit.</p><h3 id='6-lets-look-at-the-design-of-our-website-talk-me-through-the-features-that-draw-your-attention-what-do-you-like-what-do-you-dislike-what-would-you-change'>6. Lets look at the design of our website. Talk me through the features that draw your attention. What do you like, what do you dislike? What would you change?**</h3><p>This question is also different from a personal evaluation of one’s own work as it requires a certain amount of analysis about styling and techniques used. The ability to clearly articulate your creative preferences is an important characteristic of a frontend developer. This question puts people on the spot: generally developers would need 20-30 minutes to look at the page and underlying implementation, so before the interview we tend to tell the person we will be asking this. It can also work very well as a case study for a frontend developer.</p><h3 id='7-what-projects-are-you-currently-working-on-in-your-spare-time-how-did-they-come-about'>7. What projects are you currently working on in your spare time? How did they come about?**</h3><p>I love ending with this question. Developers, be it frontend or backend, who work on projects in their own time are our favorites, as it shows a love of programming outside of monetary incentives. This is also an interesting question as it gives some insight into leadership and team organizational abilities. If the developer has organized a multi-team project, which he is leading, this is a good insight into his leadership qualities.</p><h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><p>Use these questions to gauge the capability of an interview candidate in broad strokes, and if you would like to get a bit more technical here are some great resources:**</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions'>GitHub repository</a> of job interview questions for frontend web developers, including general questions, fun questions and technology-specific questions.

In Honeypot’s soon to be released research, we found no female CTOs among a sample of 58 of Berlin’s biggest startups.</p><p>The increasing number of female science, maths and technology graduates in Germany means now is a good time to begin to think about hiring more female tech talent in your company. But beyond arguments of equality or fairness, <strong>why care about increasing numbers of females in tech teams and tech leadership?</strong></p><p><strong>Because being around people who are different from us makes us  <a target='_blank' href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/' title='Scientific American diversity article'>more creative, more diligent and harder-working</a></strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The fact is that if you want to build teams or organizations capable of innovating, you need diversity.

Credit Suisse’s study divided obstacles in four categories, individual, cultural, workplace, structural/policy, which I borrow here and expand on to include tech-specific challenges:</p><p><strong>Individual</strong></p><ul><li>Educational Choices</li><li>Sector Choice</li><li>Risk Aversion disparity</li><li>Pipeline Availability</li></ul><p><strong>Cultural</strong></p><ul><li>Perception of female commitment/skill</li><li>Work-life balance priorities</li></ul><p><strong>Workplace</strong></p><ul><li>Geek culture in tech companies</li><li>Job description wording</li></ul><p><strong>Structural/Policy</strong></p><ul><li>Lack of childcare assistance</li></ul><p>While individual and structural obstacles can be difficult to overcome and certainly take a more concerted long term effort, changes in workplace and cultural contexts are easier to implement.

Even IBM, which supports a well-regarded and productive research establishment, has in recent years produced little to cause even a minor revolution in the way people think about computers.

Knowing this, I fought to bring the software legitimacy so that it (and those building it) would be given its due respect and thus I began to use the term “software engineering” to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering; yet, treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process.

      "contents": "<p>We researched 58 CTOs from Berlin’s biggest startups to reveal what it takes to be a CTO in this city. Combined our sample companies have raised more than  $3.06 billion in funding and span 26 industries. The research reveals the nationalities, educational and work background, years of experience and skills of Berlin&#39;s CTOs, along with the typical salary range.</p><h2 id='nationalities'>Nationalities</h2><p>CTOs in Berlin are fairly homogenous in terms of nationality, with close to ​ 60% hailing from Germany​ . French and American are the second most common nationalities and following this there is a diverse spread covering 13 nationalities in total.</p><blockquote><p>When looking at nationality in relation to capital raised per company, it is interesting to note that while <strong>American CTOs represent just 7% of the sample, they control 34% of the total value of the capital raised​.</strong>  This compares to German CTOs, who control 27% of the capital raised, despite representing over 60% of the group.</p></blockquote><p><img src='/assets/images/nationalities.png' alt='Berlin CTOs'></p><h2 id='job-titles'>Job Titles</h2><p>Not every startup has a CTO. This can be due to the size of the company or the unique needs of the product.  80% of the companies we surveyed had a CTO. When a full-time CTO was not present in the company, the most senior job titles for technical leaders were either SVP of Technology, VP of Engineering,  Head of IT or Chief Architect.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/title.png' alt='CTOs job titles'></p><h2 id='educational-background'>Educational Background</h2><p>Despite the precedent set by the role’s name, there is some debate in tech circles about the necessity of a technical background for CTOs. On the one hand, it can be hard to manage a development team when you have little technical knowledge or applied experience in software development. On the other hand, technical skill does not necessarily translate into leadership skill: a full-stack engineer may have all the technical knowledge but prove terrible with people..</p><blockquote><p>Our research shows that Berlin’s startups are taking diverging approaches to this challenge. <strong>Close to a third of the companies surveyed employ CTOs with non-technical backgrounds​.</strong> While technical background is not as important as expected, education in general is very valued: 100% of the CTOs surveyed had Bachelor degrees and over two-thirds of Berlin CTOs have reached Master level of education with backgrounds as diverse as Computer Science, ​ Art, Business Admin, and Physics.</p></blockquote><p>The <strong>most common educational path for Berlin CTOs is a bachelor in Computer Science followed by a Master in IT​.</strong> IT can refer to degrees such as IT Management, Business Information Systems, Business IT, and in Germany ​ <em>Wirtschaftsinformatik</em> ​(Business Informatics). This educational path reflects the dual technical and business responsibility of CTOs, who to be successful must balance a variety of topics, including information system management, project management, systems analysis and design, and networks and communications.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/education.png' alt='CTO education'></p><h2 id='skills'>Skills</h2><p>Common skills expected of a Chief Technology Officer include proficiency in the following five areas: Scrum, MySQL, Agile, Java (both backend and frontend), and PHP. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/skills.png' alt='CTOs skills'></p><h2 id='founder-experience'>Founder Experience</h2><p>Over 60% of CTOs in Berlin were either (co-)founders of a previous venture or (co-)founders of their current venture.  More often than not, CTOs are co-founders of the companies with which they currently work, reflecting the core technical skills which are frequently required to build a successful startup.</p><blockquote><p>The <strong>average years of experience Berlin’s CTOs have before entering their current position is 12</strong>, though some intrepid self-starters have entered the position just 4 years after leaving university.</p></blockquote><p><img src='/assets/images/experience.png' alt='CTOs as Founders'></p><h2 id='berlin-cto-salaries-how-much-do-they-make'>Berlin CTO Salaries: How Much Do They Make?</h2><p>Berlin CTO salaries range from as little as €58,000 to as much as €142,000 for the most experienced CTO’s at the most prestigious companies. But, on average, Berlin CTO’s make about €90,000/year.</p><h2 id='a-note-on-the-companies-surveyed'>A Note on the Companies Surveyed</h2><ul><li>All companies are HQ’d in Berlin</li><li>All companies are founded after 2006</li><li>All companies have raised a minimum of $500,000*</li></ul><p><img src='/assets/images/companies.png' alt='CTO Report'></p><p><strong>This report was compiled from Honeypot data and publically-available data on LinkedIn, Xing, and Crunchbase.

Why does this startling disconnect between recruiters and hiring managers exist?</p><p>More often than not it comes down to <strong>workflow</strong>. Workflow complications are the result of disconnects on procedures, roles, and responsibilities, the outcome of some organizational design and leadership team misalignment.</p><p>But, trust me, <em>they are solvable.</em></p><p>Honeypot users with streamlined workflows hire faster and hire better. And most importantly, candidates tend to be happier. Berlin&#39;s biggest and best recruiting teams have <strong>streamlined their workflow using Honeypot.</strong> Here&#39;s some tips on how to follow suit: </p><h3 id='1-get-your-hiring-manager-a-login-to-honeypot'>1. Get your hiring manager a login to Honeypot</h3><blockquote><p>The hiring manager is the person making the ultimate decision on which developer gets hired. So get them their own personal login! Your life will suddenly get a lot easier...</p></blockquote><h3 id='2-encourage-your-hiring-manager-to-save-their-favourite-developers'>2. Encourage your hiring manager to save their favourite developers</h3><blockquote><p>In our top performing companies, the hiring manager logs in once a week, on Mondays, copies the links of the profiles they like and sends them to the recruiter. </p></blockquote><p><img src='/assets/images/copy_talent_link.png' alt='honeypot'></p><h3 id='3-send-personalized-interview-invites-to-the-saved-developers'>3. Send personalized interview invites to the saved developers</h3><blockquote><p>The recruiter then assesses the saved profiles and <strong>sends personalized interview invites on behalf of the team</strong>. For example:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>“Our CTO saw your profile, he likes your open source contributions. I see you have four years of fulltime JavaScript experience. You seem perfect for the position of Senior Frontend Developer at our company. Lets chat!.”</strong> </p></blockquote><h3 id='4-set-up-interviews'>4. Set up interviews</h3><blockquote><p>Set up the interview with the candidate together with your hiring manager.  Easy! No messy back and forth, just a clear procedure which lets you go from candidate sourcing to candidate interview in less than a week. </p></blockquote><p>As a recruiter, setting up <strong>an effective hiring process</strong> within your startup will save you immeasurable time.  It will mean more effort spent on the quality of hires for your company and ensuring the best hiring experience for your candidates. </p><p>As a former in-house recruiter myself, I understand that good developers, like the best talents in any industry, don’t wait around for lengthy interview cycles or hefty decision-making processes! </p><p><strong>So the only thing left to ask is, does your CTO have a login for Honeypot yet?</strong> :) </p>",

Let&#39;s start with you telling us a little more about yourself.</strong></p><p>I from Kraków originally. Naturally, I’m a Wisła Kraków fan! I moved from Kraków to Berlin in August 2015. Previously I was VP of Software Development at Sabre Corporation, an American travel company, where I managed a team across six locations, including some nice exotic places like Philippines and Iceland. Onefootball is my second startup experience - I had previously worked with one during the dotcom era.</p><p><strong>What attracted you to Onefootball?</strong></p><p>I was looking for a position that was more dynamic and for a company where I could make a difference in a short time. Berlin was particularly attractive. After talking to a couple of companies here, I was happy - and lucky - to join Onefootball.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/onefootball-office.jpg' alt='onefootball developer life'></p><p><strong>What makes Berlin special?</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a very multinational place which brings lots of opportunities to mix with people with different ideas and opinions. The city itself is attractive to move to - you don&#39;t have to sell it! People want to come from all over the world. Against the backdrop of this eclectic environment, startups are thriving and it feels like the right place to be.</p><p><strong>What were your aims when joining Onefootball?</strong></p><p>The clear thing was to build a technical team identity. It was managed through product leadership previously. The company lacked a technical point of view in decision-making. I was also looking at sustainability and scalability, to make the team more organized and predictable. We are also aiming to triple the number of users.</p><h2 id='architecture'>Architecture</h2><p><strong>How many users do you currently have?</strong></p><p>We have about 20 million downloads.</p><p><strong>Can you describe the technical setup of Onefootball?</strong></p><p>We have three components on the app side - the iOS version, the Android version and the Windows version. We also have a web version which is built on Angular.Js and some other JavaScript frameworks. Most of the logic or processing power is in the backend and we have some components in PHP but we are gradually migrating to Golang. We are heavily using the Amazon stack as infrastructure as service provider. We built improvements on ability to scale.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/onefootballoffice2.jpg' alt='onefootball office'></p><p><strong>Why have you decided to move from PHP to Golang?</strong></p><p>There are two main reasons for us. First, PHP was becoming too complicated to manage. And second, Golang was a very nice tool to use from the microservices approach. It&#39;s not easy to find companies using Go and it was new for me to learn too. But it&#39;s pretty exciting.</p><p><strong>Onefootball is transitioning into a microservices architecture. What motivated this?</strong></p><p>We have two or three main components of our app. One is getting all of the information from our partners about the games. This is very data-driven. We get updates every second during the game, then we store it in our database, process it and send it through web services. This is the part where we used to have one piece of code, or a logic, which gathered all of this information and then sent it to the database.</p><p>Right now we are dividing the monolith logic into separate services which are operating on certain pieces of the data: the providers and the information which is pushed into the database is separate from the logic which is servicing the information to the apps or to the consumers. We can now make changes in a very independent way, using separate way points and separate services. Each of them is also easily scalable.</p><h2 id='engineering-team'>Engineering Team</h2><p><img src='/assets/images/onefootballoffice1.jpg' alt='onefootball office'></p><p><strong>How many developers do you have on your engineering team?</strong></p><p>The engineering team is about 26 people. We are hiring and growing each team. We are looking for Android, iOS developers, Golang developers, and DevOps.</p><p><strong>How are the teams structured?</strong></p><p>We have backend together and then we have an iOS team, an Android team and a web team. In terms of nationality, our current team is probably the most diverse team I have ever managed.</p><p><strong>How would you describe developer culture within Onefootball?</strong></p><p>From an organizational point of view, we have a very flat and open structure. Every Friday we have updates for the whole team which usually ends up with a few beers. We use Agile pretty heavily, we try to follow Scrum as close as possible. We have internal tech talks and we participate in Berlin events.</p><p><strong>Is everyone at Onefootball a huge football fan?</strong></p><p>Haha, well we have people who are huge football fanatics and we have casual supporters, so it&#39;s a mix. One of the things we store in our HR system is what team you follow. We also play football twice a week and we have several events around tournaments and competitions.</p><p><strong>Are you a football fan!?</strong></p><p>As I said, I follow Wisła Kraków. I also follow the national championships. Poland qualified...finally!</p><p><img src='/assets/images/onefootballoffice3.jpg' alt='onefootball office'></p><p><strong>What is the biggest technical challenge you are currently facing?</strong></p><p>Like all companies, our biggest challenge is keeping that balance between product development and delivering new features, while keeping the infrastructure stable. We want to focus on doing things right and making sure we are prepared for growth. The second challenge we are facing is the preparation for Euro 2016. We are expecting tripling of our users - which is a good problem to have!</p><p><strong>What are you aims for the coming year from a technical point of view?</strong></p><p>It will be the combination of building a scalable and flexible backend. We also would like to look into more user-based behaviour driven functionality and look into gamification. The last thing is we are building a community of Football fans and bloggers and tools needed for this.</p><p><strong>Thanks Grzegorz!

      "contents": "<p>Community Devs is a series of interviews with developers working in Europe&#39;s startup hubs. Our first interview is with Oleg Ilyenko, a Scala developer based in Berlin. He is creator of <a target='_blank' href='http://sangria-graphql.org/'>Sangria</a>, a Scala GraphQL Implementation. Honeypot will be hosting a <a target='_blank' href='https://honeypot-tech-talks-graphql.eventbrite.de'>GraphQL meetup</a> on May 11th.</p><p><strong>You spent the first 7 years of your career as a Java developer before you discovered Scala. What inspired you to change direction?</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a funny story. I looked at Scala a couple of times before getting into it. I actually got into Groovy before Scala. Scala really caught my attention when I discovered an article <a target='_blank' href='http://macstrac.blogspot.de/2009/04/scala-as-long-term-replacement-for.html'>“Scala as the long term replacement for java/javac?”</a> by James Strachan (the creator of Groovy) saying: “I can honestly say if someone had shown me  <em>Programming in Scala</em> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon &amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I&#39;d probably have never created Groovy”.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of using Scala over Java?</strong></p><p>Scala is a more expressive language, you are able to describe your business logic in a more intuitive way. It provides more type-safety, which means that more invariants can be defined at compile-time. This helps a lot with long-term project maintenance and safe, fast refactorings.</p><p>Another aspect in which Scala excels is immutability support. One can write immutable code in Java as well, but it requires much more effort and dedication. In Scala it’s the most natural way of writing code and is a default in most of the cases.</p><p>Now that Java 8 has function literals, one could argue that it now also has some support for functional programming. Scala, on the other hand, embraces functional programming and provides support for it which goes far beyond support of function literals.</p><p><strong>Some argue that Scala is overly complex, in its use of functions, macros and tuples, for example. What are your thoughts on that?</strong></p><p>There are new concepts to be learnt when programming with Scala, that&#39;s true. I would argue though, that there are good reasons for these concepts to be in the language. Tuple is a simple example of it - it’s just a pair of values. Every single Java project, I had the pleasure of work on, had a class called Pair or KeyValue. So I find it very helpful that Scala supports this concept out-of-the-box. And it’s reoccurring topic: as I was learning Scala I  was often reminded of <em><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683'>“Effective Java”</a></em> book by Joshua Bloch  - almost every chapter of the book is addressed by Scala on a language or standard library level.</p><p>When I have a discussion on this topic, I often get an argument that Java is more simpler language with less syntax, concepts and language constructs to learn, which makes it easier to read and understand code, especially for junior developers. In my experience though, most of the complexity comes from business requirements and complex business logic. Scala provides developers more tools to capture and express this business logic in a way that is much closer to the language of the domain experts.</p><p>We have heard developers complain that because code bases written in Scala can be difficult to maintain because of the flexibility of the language: you can write object-oriented code or functional code, for example. If the team doesn’t have strict guidelines on how the code should be written, the code base gets unmaintainable. What&#39;s your experience with this?</p><p>In my opinion this can be a concern for any language. For more than 2 years now I have been working on a big Scala SaaS project. We do embrace functional programming and immutability, but we also don’t shy away from object-oriented approach and mutability in some cases where we see clear need for it - some performance-critical parts of the application may require it, for instance. We don’t have any issues with communication between developers, in fact we have very good synergy within the team. I think it all comes to people - their character, ability to present arguments and find a consensus. That’s why I find it crucial to involve developers in all stages of hiring process. This is what our company always did, and I can see a clear evidence that this approach not only works, but also also has a very high success rate in form of good synergy within a team.</p><p><strong>There are plenty of JVM languages out there, like Clojure. What do you think the benefits of Scala over Clojure are?</strong></p><p>I glad that you mentioned Clojure. I like Clojure a lot, it’s one of my favourite programming languages. Though I find it hard to compare Scala with Clojure. I think it depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for statically typed language, then in my opinion Scala is the best choice. If you want a dynamic language then Clojure is the way to go. I really appreciate the work they are doing on the Clojure - it innovates in many areas and I see a lot of evidence of Clojure and it’s ecosystem being inspiration to other programming language communities and projects.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/java-scala.png' alt='java scala pay difference'></p><h2 id='scala-community'>Scala Community</h2><p><strong>How would you describe the Scala community?</strong></p><p>As with many technology-related things, it wouldn’t be very useful without community support. Thankfully, the Scala community and ecosystem of libraries does it’s best to embrace functional programming, type-safety, immutability and high code quality. I see strong vision and sense of purpose within the Scala community. This is invaluable not only for programming language communities, but also for teams, organisations and companies working with the language, It may look invisible at first, but with a time one can start to notice it’s influence in different parts of ecosystem like, for example, in a work on <a target='_blank' href='http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/'>Reactive Manifesto</a>.</p><p><strong>What should Scala developers in Berlin know about the Berlin Scala community?</strong></p><p>I have been a member of the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/'>Berlin Scala</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.meetup.com/Play-Berlin-Brandenburg/'>Play user groups</a> for about 4 years now. At my first Scala user group meetup there were just 30 people. Today, the Scala user group struggles to find a place large enough to host all the members. It’s amazing to see the growth of Berlin Scala community over the years. We already had several great hackathons with large number of attendees and the next one already scheduled close to the Scala Days conference. This year is the second time Scala Days conference takes place in Berlin.</p><p><strong>Which Berlins startups are working with Scala?</strong></p><p>I already saw Scala being used in many startups. Its also gaining popularity in bigger, more mature companies as well. Scala is already 12 years old but the decision to change the programming language of a company is based on a complex interaction between company organization and company culture. In my experience it often requires tight cooperation and collaboration between developers and management for this change to happen. There is much less risk now to adopt Scala - there are plenty of learning resources and a very rich ecosystem of libraries (which includes Java libraries as well). Berlin companies using Scala,  like SoundCloud, HERE, eBay and Zalando, make it easier for a smaller companies to make this decision and embrace Scala as well. Many companies in Berlin are now <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/how_it_works?utm_source=commdevscala'>hiring Scala developers</a>.</p><h2 id='graphql'>GraphQL</h2><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='http://sangria-graphql.org/'>Sangria</a>, a GraphQL implementation for Scala, is one of your most successful open source projects. Can you tell us about GraphQL?</strong></p><p>GraphQL allows you to build API with high emphasis on efficient data retrieval and introspection with a powerful type-system behind it. It becomes even more powerful when combined with client-side frameworks like React and Relay, allowing you to build an application based on highly decoupled components without sacrificing performance or over-/under-fetching a data needed for the views. Web application development is not the only area where GraphQL excels. Any area that requires very precise and performant data fetching/manipulation, like mobile application development, can profit from GraphQL.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/oleg.jpg' alt='oleg'></p><p><strong>When did you first hear about GraphQL?</strong></p><p>I’m very excited about Sangria - a GraphQL implementation for Scala. I learnt about GraphQL about a year ago and since than I’ve become more and more excited about this concept. I wouldn’t say that it’s a replacement for a REST API - I believe that it can  nicely complement REST API. Embracing GraphQL will unlock it’s full potential though.</p><p><strong>Would you consider putting GraphQL as a public interface into your API?</strong></p><p>This is a topic I definitely would like to explore. At the moment, Facebook uses it internally and many people use it with Relay, a Javascript framework from Facebook, to build a single page applications. I would really like to explore the use of GraphQL as a public API. In my opinion it can solve many problems that people are facing with REST API - over- and under-fetching of the data, API evolution over the time, API documentation and introspection, etc.</p><p><strong>What are the potential drawbacks of putting GraphQL as a public interface into your API?</strong></p><p>Exposing public GraphQL API raises several concerns as well. Since data query languages provide a much more powerful mechanism to fetch data than a simple fetch of resources or a list of resources, it becomes much easier to misuse and abuse it by making very expensive request to the GraphQL server. In Sangria I implemented several mechanism to perform a static query complexity analysis, but I still think that there is a room for improvement in this area. GraphQL is still very young technology, so I’m sure that with the time GraphQL community will good solutions to these concerns.</p><p><strong>Is it possible to restrict access to some resources with GraphQL?</strong></p><p>GraphQL itself doesn’t cover authentication and authorization but it’s possible to implement a security mechanism on top of it. The nice thing about GraphQL is that it is completely backend agnostic. This means that you can implement a GraphQL server with any programming language, transport protocol, data format, database or security mechanism of your choice.</p><p><strong>Is GraphQL becoming popular across other languages?</strong></p><p>It’s becoming popular in many different communities. When Facebook open-sourced GraphQL, they also open-sourced the reference implementation for Node.js, so it was the first GraphQL server implementation. Facebook internally uses PHP/Hack and as far as I heard they plan to open-source it at some point as well. At this point there are implementations of GraphQL server for at least 12 programming languages like Scala, Java, Ruby, Python, etc. And this number keeps growing. It’s amazing to see how much traction and community support GraphQL specification has.</p><h2 id='reactive-programming'>Reactive Programming</h2><p><strong>Aside from GraphQL are there any other technologies you are particularly excited about?</strong></p><p>Reactive programming is something I am really excited about as well. It helps to build applications that are responsive, and resilient - two traits that are crucial for modern SaaS applications in my opinion. I am always in favour of data-flow driven applications that are based on an event-stream processing as a primary building block, in contrast to control-flow driven applications.</p><p><strong>Can you see reactive programming supporting microservices architecture?</strong></p><p>Indeed, reactive programming can be very helpful when implementing a microservice architecture. Ideally you would like to separate services based on the business value and functionality. This means that it is crucial to ensure that services are resilient to a failure and you don’t end up in situation where error in one service cascades to other services and brings the whole system down.</p><p>Different services may also have very different scalability requirement and different SLAs (Service Level Agreement). This means that services need to be elastic and dynamically scale based on the workload and in order to fulfill SLAs for a peak workloads and don’t waste hardware resources for lower workloads. This is where reactive programming and Reactive Manifesto comes to rescue.The thing about microservices is it is still very broadly defined. There is no single simply definition for it and many people interpret. Some people would argue that it is indeed connected.</p><p><strong>What other open source projects are you working on?</strong></p><p>Another project I’m working on is Scaldi - a lightweight Scala dependency injection library. It started as an experiment which evolved into a nice Scala DSL (Domain Specific Language). It comes out-of the-box with Akka and Play 2.5 support and is used by several projects as well, like Skinny Framework.</p><p><strong>How do you think new ideas in programming become popular?</strong></p><p>I don’t think there is a definitive answer to this question, or at least I don’t know one. As far as I saw, most of the popular and innovative ideas are born from a real necessity for something that impossible or very hard to achieve otherwise, and by impossible I mean that it takes too much time and effort to be worth it.</p><p>I think the first most import question one need to answer is “why?”, as with ideas and products in any other industries. This will help people realise the value and potential of the idea. What exactly you are building and how you are building it are important topics as well, but they are secondary in my opinion.</p><p>I also strongly believe that additional care should be given in building a community around this idea. Even the best ideas are not very helpful if nobody is aware of them or nobody cares because of unhealthy community. Most of the time implementation of an idea and it’s refinement is a collaborative effort.</p><p><strong>What do you see as the most exciting developments for Scala over the coming year?</strong></p><p>I’m excited about Scala 2.12, which should be released very soon. It will bring better interoperability with Java 8. This will allow Scala take advantage of many new features of Java 8, which would mean a lot of performance improvements as well.</p><p>I also very interested in further development of Dotty - a new experimental Scala compiler. It&#39;s still  in early stages of development, but it already looks very promising and may provide a solid base for many future language improvements.</p><p>And last, but not the least, further development of Sangria, of course!</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160501&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>As an extension of our previous blog post <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/interview-questions-for-a-frontend-developer/'>“interview questions for a frontend developer”</a>, I have put together a helpful list of 5 interview questions for a backend developer.. Being a member of the talent rep team at Honeypot, I know from my own experiences how difficult it can be to figure  out where to start a conversation with a backend developer. There are just too many topics, language and tools - not enough time!</p><p><strong>What is your favourite programming language? - and why?</strong></p><p>I find that when it comes to backend developers - particularly experienced ones - this is a “safe” opener, as it is a fairly simple question and a nice way to ease into the conversation. Furthermore, it gives the developer a chance to freely talk about their work experience and preferences, and more importantly; it gives you a chance to judge how enthusiastic they are  about what they do. In my experience the best developers are the ones who can go on-and-on about the languages and frameworks they use, and passionately explain to you why PHP or Ruby or Elixir might more suitable for certain tasks than others.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the software lifecycle at your most recent position?  What did you enjoy the most? What would have you liked to change?</strong></p><p>Today most companies will claim they have adopted an Agile methodology in relation to software development, a circular process where each step is constantly revisited, inspected and improved. However, in reality the software lifecycle often fit somewhere between Agile and the previously popular Waterfall approach, which is more of a progressional flow, where each stage is fully completed before moving onto the next. Therefore it is super relevant to ensure that the person you are interviewing will be a right fit not only for your organisation, but also within the development team, by ensuring workflow compatibility.</p><p><strong>What is the largest web application you have ever worked on? -  and what coding were you responsible for?</strong></p><p>I suppose this question is pretty self explanatory, but the reason I tend to ask it is that it allows me to gain a deeper insight into the work of the developer. Sometimes you will come across CV’s, GitHub profiles etc. that contains truly amazing work, but you might not necessarily be able to grasp the role fulfilled by the developer in question. I don’t consider this question a “test” to make sure the interviewee is being sincere, but rather a way of unearthing  their abilities to function in a team, handle complex tasks or just generally gain a better understanding of workflow processes.</p><p><strong>What is your understanding and experience with object-oriented programming (OOP)?</strong></p><p>Object-oriented programming can be a hard topic to explain in just a few lines, however understanding the interviewee’s relationship and experience with OOP is highly relevant in order for you to get a better understanding of what kind of software developer you are dealing with. Since the late 90’s OOP has been the general practice when organising code, which is a way of generalising and objectifying certain groups of code and making it possible to apply them to various situations. Alternatively developers might use “procedural programming” where the organisation of code is more focused in action rather than object. Therefore asking this question will allow you to delve deeper into the mindset and routines of the developer you are talking to.</p><p><strong>Have you ever experienced OOP go wrong?  - and what elements of OO design are most prone to abuse and misuse? How may this be prevented?</strong></p><p>This question serves as an extension of the previous, and encourages the developer to express him/herself more freely regarding OOP, but also allows you to determine to what extent the developer is comfortable critiquing and challenging the tools and processes they operate within. Whether that means limitations within programming languages, classes or methods is not important. Ultimately you want what is best for your business, and you want to be able to progress and make logical changes, and in order to do that you need people around you who are problem-solvers. Personally I have come across several developers working in within organisational structures that inhibit them in evolving and becoming better programmers, and in these cases years of experience loses out to work morals and attitude.</p><p>The examples of questions used in this post are designed to be broad and applicable to most backend developers, regardless of programming language. For more in-depth tech-driven questions refer to <a target='_blank' href='http://katemats.com/interview-questions/'>Kate{mats}</a> &amp; <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/starandtina/backend-interview-questions'>GitHub Repository</a>, and if you are looking for more language-specific questions check out these YouTube videos giving examples of  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njZ48YVkei0'>Java</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6pkAWCewLs'>PHP</a>-related questions.</p><p>Backend development is an immense topic and the list of relevant interview questions is endless. Having a few solid ones in the back of your mind is very useful for me when venturing into a new round of interviews - I hope they will be for you as well.</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/for_employers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=g&amp;utm_content=160502&amp;utm_campaign=hr-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and connect with top, pre-screened developers.

The Hamburg-based company is continuously pushing the boundaries, from mapping Yosemite’s iconic <a target='_blank' href='https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/yosemite/'>El Capitan</a> to creating a Street View of the world’s largest model railway. At the technical helm is Martin Kleppe, Head of Development and a passionate developer and active member of JS community.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/ubilabs.png' alt='ubilabs overview'></p><p><strong>Ubilabs mapped El Capitan, the mystical summit which is over 1,000 metres high, at the centre of Yosemite National Park in California. Can you tell us about the project?</strong></p><p>Google has been running its Trekker Program since 2013 with the aim of making some of the world’s most beautiful peaks accessible to everyone. El Capitan is the first vertical street view trek that Google have ever done. We were responsible for designing and launching the Google Street View Trek microsite. It was a very exciting project to work on!</p><p><strong>How was the project organized?</strong></p><p>Google came to us with the idea and we started to brainstorm. We began to prototype in the browser. There were a number of challenges right from the start. The first was to create a &quot;map&quot; of a vertical trek. Maps are usually viewed from above, so a vertical trek challenges this idea:  we used a photo from El Capitan and put an animated SVG path on top. A second big challenge was to highlight special areas in the panos and created &quot;sticky&quot; hotspots that provide more info about the content.</p><p><strong>What other projects have you worked on with Google?</strong></p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/khumbu/'>Mount Everest Khumbu</a>  was another awesome project we worked on. And <a target='_blank' href='https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/miniatur-wunderland/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464250230867000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIvbFFJ9LOjaTaLiJGaom3d44EbA'>Miniatur Wunderland</a>  here in Hamburg Germany, a Street View of a model railway, which was built to scale of 1:87, was pretty special too. For that we won a <a target='_blank' href='http://webbyawards.com/winners/2016/advertising-media/websites-micro-sites-and-rich-media/tourism-leisure/miniatur-wunderland-trek/'>Webby Award</a>! For the Wonderland project we built the cameras used to capture over 10,000 photos, which we then pushed the images into Google’s Street View pipeline.</p><p><strong>Ubilabs is continuously trying and testing new technologies. What technologies excite you at the moment?</strong></p><p>We are working on some really cool stuff. It has become possible to code interactive VR scenes on a mobile browser using JavaScript. And we are using WebGL and Three.js on top of the Google Maps API to draw millions of data points and make them interactive. This was not possible until quite recently because of the limitation of CPU power.</p><p><strong>How did you become the Google Maps Partner?</strong></p><p>We worked really early with the Google Maps API. We got in contact with the developers of the Google Maps API and we also had a strong connection on the sales side. In 2013, Ubilabs was awarded the Premier Partner status based on our expertise and success in helping customers deploy and use Google Maps for Work solutions. Also thanks to our teamwork with Google, we are one of just two Premier Partners in Germany.</p><p><strong>How does your partnership with Google work?</strong></p><p>Google offers the Google API without any additional service. You can use Google Maps for free under certain conditions: it has to be public, you can’t have a login, and so on. In other cases, clients might call Google just because they need help to implement the APIs. And Google will pass that customer on to us for help them with the technical implementation or license-related questions.</p><p><strong>What are the key skills of developers working on interactive maps?</strong></p><p>We work on quite complex technology, which is frequently very new. You don’t need to be someone with a computer science degree but you should be curious and passionate. You have to have a good way to structure your work and a feeling for how to make code easy to understand and manage for others. Good visual sensibilities are also essential because maps are so visual: colour, typography, how to use lines and stuff like this is all very important.</p><div class='video-wrapper'>  <iframe width='854' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTxtiLp1C8Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><strong>How are projects organized at Ubilabs?</strong></p><p>We are not an agency and we are not a tech startup focused on one project – we are somewhere in between. At any given time we have people working on different technologies – one focused on 3D, one focused on Google infrastructure, for example. And our projects can range in length from 5 days to 1 year. Our developers and designers like that we have new projects continuously and that we are not bound to one technology decision. It’s more like continuously trying something new, and improving or rejecting technologies along the way.</p><p><strong>What excites you about the future of maps?</strong></p><p>There is so much going on with interactive maps in the browser, so many different levels coming together. You can really pack a lot of information into a map. There are so many new technologies emerging every day.  </p><p><strong>What is it like to found a startup in Hamburg? What are the advantages?</strong></p><p>We are not a startup anymore, but 10 years ago, when we were a startup, there was very little going on in Berlin. Everyone said that it&#39;s not the right place to go. It changed hugely in the last five years of course. Nonetheless, there are some great developers in Hamburg and a  good demo scene. Recently I co-organized the <a target='_blank' href='http://2016.jsunconf.eu/'>JSUnconf</a> here in Hamburg and I also organize the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/'>Hamburg JavaScript meetup</a>.  Aside from work, Hamburg is a nice city to live in – it&#39;s small and focused. It is super green and people are very nice.</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160505&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>An introduction to errors and exceptions handling using Rust as example.</p><h3 id='general-definitions'>General definitions</h3><p><strong>Error</strong>: An unusual and unexpected situation in the running program that can be resolved only by fixing the program (i.e. <em>out of memory</em>).</p><p><strong>Exception</strong>: An expected and irregular situation that happens at runtime (i.e. <em>read-protected file</em>).</p><p>The main difference here is that errors are <strong>unexpected</strong> (and usually lead to exploitable bugs) and are often hard to predict(did someone whisper <em>overflow</em>?), while exceptions are expected (you know that they <em>could</em> happen) and usually lead to a crashof the application when not handled (for example when you want to modify a file that actually does not exist but you didn&#39;t think about this possibility).</p><h3 id='how-popular-languages-deal-with-exceptions'>How popular languages deal with exceptions</h3><p>We could split programming languages into four categories based on the way they handle exceptions:</p><ul><li>Strict exception handling: the language provides full and explicit coverage to exceptions. Exceptions are defined as classes (either built-in and definedby the developer) that represent the type of exception they handle. Methods are shipped with a list of exceptions they can rise (explicitely or just byinvoking other functions) and require to be handled with a <code>Try...catch</code>-like construct. Not handled exceptions lead to a compile-time error.</li><li>Weak exception handling: everything that&#39;s been said for the <em>strict exception handling</em> languages with the addition that developers are not requiredto handle exceptions and methods are not shipped with any definition of the exceptions they can rise demanding this task to the documentation.Exceptions that are not handled lead to an abortion of the application at run time.</li><li>Exceptions-agnostic: exception handling is not provided by the language but can be implemented (usually with conditional statements and <code>goto</code>s).</li><li>By monadic types: exception handling is realized with generic structs in which values are encapsulated.</li></ul><p>The most popular language that implements the features of the first category is <em>Java</em>.The second category is basically huge, and includes most of the languages over here: <em>C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript</em> and so on.</p><p>Usually handling exceptions in this very OOPish way is quite expensive in terms of resources. The <em>C</em> programming language does not have any knowledgeabout exceptions and most projects (the <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9256d5a308c95a50c6e85d682492ae1f86a70f9b/drivers/media/dvb-frontends/drxk_hard.c#L518'>Linux kernel</a>included) handle them with <code>if</code>s and <code>goto</code>s to jump to the block where a task gets rescued.It&#39;s obvious that this trait asks developers to be completely aware about all the edge cases of their code and to write especially clean code.</p><p>The last category is the most appreciated inside the functional programming world. The concept is that instead of returning <code>NULL</code>s or raisingexceptions in case of failures (i.e. an hashtable that does not include a given key), an option type is used that can either encapsulates a valueor being empty. <em>Haskell</em> uses an option type called <code>Maybe</code> that accepts <code>Nothing</code> or <code>Just x</code> while <em>Rust, Scala, OCaml, Swift</em> and others usean <code>Option</code> type that accepts <code>None</code> or <code>Some(T)</code>. Through decostruction via pattern matching, the developer can handle both of these cases.</p><p>Let&#39;s see shortly what in practice this does mean exemplifying with a language that despite is not purely functional, implements and makes extensive use of monadic types.</p><h3 id='exception-handling-in-rust'>Exception handling in Rust</h3><p>This section wants to go a little deeper on what it&#39;s been said previously. Please look at <a target='_blank' href='http://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/'>this article</a>and the <a target='_blank' href='https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/'>Rust book</a> for a great learning about this!</p><p>As said, talking about exceptions, the only tools Rust gives to developers are <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. They are everything but magic,being so easy that you can implement them by yourself in a couple of lines, as done in the article linked above.And they are terribly optimized in compile-time too, so that their usage is almost cost-free.</p><h3 id='optiont'><code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></h3><p>I&#39;m the kind of person who prefers to leave the code to talk for itself. Please have a look at<a target='_blank' href='https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=2636dd21ba2b1317ae0d4287bb5bc862&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0'>this snippet</a>.</p><p>We define a dictionary containing the name of the books as key and the count of volumes in the stock as value.The <code>get()</code> method returns an option type that we want to deconstruct through pattern matching, extracting so its value if it&#39;s present.</p><p>Instead of using pattern matching we can also <code>unwrap()</code> the value directly in<a target='_blank' href='https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=9dc9e5ac92d8f3f14d30e55eb58bc3a8&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0'>this way</a>.This method basically extracts the value from an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, assuming it <code>is_some()</code>.</p><p>It is quite a double edged weapon though. If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> <code>is_none()</code>, meaning that it has not a valueencapsulated, it will <code>panic!</code> as you can see <a target='_blank' href='https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=6ce0014f989ce2cd6668278e98e09cf3&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0'>here</a>.</p><p><code>panic!</code> is a macro defined in the Rust&#39;s standard library that aborts the current thread (this means that our multi-threaded applications can be stillalive too :)), causing most of the times the crash of the application, in the same flavor of a Ruby or Python&#39;s unhandled exception.</p><p>We don&#39;t care that our returned value is an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of the plain value as long as we don&#39;t need to use it. Pattern matching, <code>unwrap()</code>,<code>unwrap_or()</code> and <code>unwrap_or_else()</code> (<a target='_blank' href='https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap'>documented here</a>) are usually everythingwe need to keep our code safe from unexpected values that can be returned.</p><p>We can live in a world without <code>NULL</code>s. It sounds kinda like a dream, doesn&#39;t it? But it&#39;s real.</p><h3 id='resultt-e'><code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code></h3><p>This thing really looks like an exception class. If <em>option types</em> represent a possibility for a value to exists, <em>result types</em> represent a successor a failure of a task (i.e. the creation of a file).</p><p>Basically it works like <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but instead of accepting <code>Some(T)</code> or <code>None</code>, these options are replaced by <code>Ok(T)</code> and <code>Err(E)</code>.<code>Ok(T)</code> basically works exactly like <code>Some(T)</code>, encapsulating a generic value, while <code>Err(E)</code> is a wrapper for a value that represents the error (as itis generic, despite what it can looks like, it can be whatever thing you like, a string containing an error message included).</p><h3 id='what-about-errors'>What about errors?</h3><p>Initially we said that errors are unexpected and unusual situations in which the program can end into.</p><p>Most of the languages represents the most common errors with actual exceptions (i.e. <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>) but they&#39;re not really supposed to be handled,and so what they do is only giving a reasonable message about the reason of the crash of the application.</p><p>Smart compilers like Rust&#39;s help avoiding errors in compile time, providing strict rules and checkings on everything the programmer does, likethe ones related to the memory management.</p><p>In case of errors like an index out of an array&#39;s bound (which index could be inputted by the user and cannot always be expected, for example),actually there&#39;s a brand new <code>panic::catch_unwind()</code> method that does exactly what <code>Try...catch</code> or <code>Begin...rescue</code> do, but it needs to be usedconscientiously, as it is <em>not</em> a shorthand for option and result types.Please read <a target='_blank' href='http://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/26/Rust-1.9.html'>Rust 1.9 announcement</a> to learn more about catching <code>panic!</code>s and more.</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160506&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

What is often forgotten is Hamburg, the leafy, fiercely proud port city in Germany’s north west. A city with a vibrant history of trade and media is slowly and silently developing as a tech hub in its own right. More understated than Munich, a lot friendlier than Berlin, and with a strong regional character of its own, Hamburg has a lot to offer entrepreneurs.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='/assets/images/hamburg-startup-bigger.png'><img src='/assets/images/hamburg_startup_map.png' alt='berlin&#39;s startups'></a></p><p>According to the Hamburg Startup Monitor, there were <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hamburg-startups.net/hamburg-startup-monitor-results-of-the-first-study-have-arrived/'>500 innovative digital startups</a> in 2014 in Hamburg. To celebrate <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/how_it_works?utm_source=hamstart'>Honeypot’s launch in the Hansestadt</a> we mapped 157 startups onto Hamburg’s train system and categorised them by industry.

Along with Frankfurt, Munich, and Berlin, Hamburg’s reputation as a tech haven has played a major role in Germany’s emergence at the forefront of global tech. Here are some top Hamburg tech companies in a variety of sectors:</p><ul><li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Goodgames, Bigpoint, Innogames</li><li><strong>Marketing</strong> &amp; advertising: Smaato, Akanoo, Channel Pilot</li><li><strong>Finance:</strong> Deposit Solutions, Kreditech, Billing Engine</li><li><strong>Ecommerce:</strong> About You, Style Lounge, Avocado Store</li><li><strong>Transport:</strong> DreamLines, BorderGuru, ShipCloud</li><li><strong>International</strong> tech companies: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Yelp</li></ul><h2 id='big-tech-in-hamburg'>Big Tech in Hamburg</h2><p>In 2005, when Stephan Uhrenbacher founded <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qype'>Qype</a> in Hamburg, Europe’s largest local review website, the German startup scene was small, very small.  In Berlin, the Samwer brothers were just “emerging from the woods near Potsdam.&quot; In southern Germany there were some larger, corporate tech companies. And in Hamburg there was dating site <a target='_blank' href='https://www.parship.de/'>Parship</a> and careers network <a target='_blank' href='https://www.xing.com/'>Xing</a>, and little else.</p><p>By 2012, when Qype was acquired by Yelp for $50 million, things in Germany looked quite different. Berlin was firmly established as Germany’s startup capital. But Hamburg had begun to assert itself as an important destination for “big tech”.</p><p>In April 2011, a year prior to Yelp’s acquisition of Qype, Airbnb opened their first office outside of the US, choosing Hamburg as the base. A year earlier, Facebook had opened an office in the city close to Google, who had been there since 2001. Microsoft, Twitter, Hootsuite and Dropbox all now have offices in the city.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/big_tech_hamburg.png' alt='technology companies in Hamburg'></p><p>Hamburg’s IT industry generates just under $4.5 billion every year says Alex Ahom, Founder of co-working space and online platform <a target='_blank' href='http://www.shhared.de/'>Shhared</a>, pointing out, “Very recently Dropbox opened an office in Hamburg and I’m sure the list of large tech firms will  continue to grow in the city.”</p><p>The impact of the settlement of big technology companies in the city on talent has been positive, “few people would have considered moving to Germany in 2005, but I think that has changed. Germany - and Hamburg - has become more attractive,” says Stephan Uhrenbacher.</p><p>Hamburg has felt the spillover effects of skilled professionals moving from big tech to found their own startups and the scene is well and truly established. At the heart of the scene is <a target='_blank' href='http://monitor.hamburg-startups.net/'>hamburg-startups.net</a>, a private initiative  founded by Sanja Stankovic and Sina Gritzuhn with the aim of establishing links in the ecosystem through <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hamburg-startups.net/hamburg-startup-monitor-results-of-the-first-study-have-arrived/'>reports</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hamburg-startups.net/startupsreeperbahn-2015-pitch/'>events</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hamburg-startups.net/blog/'>editorial</a>.</p><p>So what are the startup industries that people are flocking to in Hamburg? No report of Hamburg would be complete without looking at the city’s games industry.</p><h2 id='games-in-hamburg'>Games in Hamburg</h2><p>While big budget, console game development has been the focus of the British game industry, Germany - and in particular Hamburg - has grown to become Europe’s leader in free-to-play and browser game development.

But Kai and Christian Wawrzinek, along with third co-founder Fabian Ritter, managed to grow the company from an initial €500,000 seed investment in 2009 to revenues of at €202 million by 2014. Empire: Four Kingdoms, a mobile game developed by the company, was the world’s highest-grossing app by a German company in 2015.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.innogames.com/'>InnoGames</a> another pillar of Hamburg’s gaming scene,  has a total of 150 million registered players worldwide and reported revneue of <a target='_blank' href='http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/18/innogames-mobile-stable-sees-100-percent-growth-in-2015-thanks-to-forge-of-empires/'>$111.14 million in 2015</a> Founded in 2007, the company gained early success with browser games such as Die Stämme / Tribal Wars and more recently has begun to put emphasis on mobile games, including the popular Forge of Empires.</p><p>The success of Hamburg’s gaming industry has attracted foreign investment. In March 2016, Chinese game publisher Youzu acquired <a target='_blank' href='http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/22/chinas-youzu-interactive-buys-germanys-online-game-developer-bigpoint-for-89-7m/'>Bigpoint for €80 million</a>.

Today Gamigo has 100 employees in Hamburg, Berlin,  Münster and Chicago and since 2015 has expanded into platform services, through the acquisition of various smaller companies, including Piraya GmbH, GameSpree GmbH, Infernum Games GmbH and Looki Publishing GmbH. Gamigo’s revenues hit €21.6 million in 2015.  Other publishers have decided to focused on more niche areas: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.intenium.de/en/index.html'>Intenium</a> , for example, concentrate on female gamers.

Hamburg has long been a centre for media and advertising: 3000 press and broadcasting companies operate in the city, including Spiegel and ZEIT as well as Gruner + Jahr. On top of that, almost <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nextmedia-hamburg.de/en/initiative/media-digital-city-hamburg/'>three quarters of Germany’s top 25 printed publications</a> are produced in Hamburg and the city is home to about <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nextmedia-hamburg.de/en/initiative/media-digital-city-hamburg/'>6,000 journalists</a>.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/adtech-hamburg.png' alt='adtech companies in Hamburg'></p><p>AdTech and MarTech tend to be complementary but target slightly different audiences.

Outside of major industries such as Games, AdTech and FinTech, smaller startups are exploring innovative ideas in various other areas, including smart home and hardware startups, like <a target='_blank' href='http://brightup.de/'>BrightUp</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.roccat.com/'>Roccat</a>, meeting tools, like <a target='_blank' href='https://www.mindflowapp.me/'>Mindflow</a>,  fraud detection and security startups, such as <a target='_blank' href='https://riskident.com/en/'>Risk Ident</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.teamdrive.com/en/'>TeamDrive</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://secucloud.com/en/company/about-us'>Secucloud</a>, and many more creative innovations covering everything from healthcare to machine learning.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/other-hamburg.png' alt='startups in Hamburg'></p><p>Ask anyone of Hamburg’s successful startups why they settled in the city and they will all start with the obvious: the quality of life.

Given its size, the community is very tightly-knit, with many people knowing each other. <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hamburg-startups.net/'>Hamburg Startups</a> is the number one source for startup news in the city, covering events, funding and new founders.

      "contents": "<p>If anyone knows what it takes to build a successful startup in Hamburg, it&#39;s Stephan Uhrenbacher, CEO and now Founder of FLIO - the global airport app. Uhrenbacher previously founded Qype, Europe’s largest local review site. He sold it to Yelp in 2012 for €50 million and has since founded short term lettings platform 9flats.com and Germany’s leading eco market place avocadostore.de. </p><p><strong>What are the advantages of founding a startup in Hamburg?</strong> </p><p>There are two major advantages: the professional heritage and the lifestyle.  I work from London a lot but London is incredibly stressful, incredibly expensive, and people are always a little bit desperate about making their rent. And while I like Berlin, I always found it difficult to access people with exactly the right spirit I wanted to work with. For me it was mostly a lifestyle choice. Hamburg is large enough and it&#39;s growing like crazy. There is not so much competition from other startups and there is a very solid base of professional people who have been trained in official media. We have  a big heritage of ex-Google and ex-Facebook people and a large network of Rails developers. It&#39;s a much smaller scene than Berlin but there is more focus on creating something which is commercially viable. There is a lot of talent here. Having said that, I still think that you have a big advantage if you are tapped into the network in London or Berlin. </p><p><strong>How has traditional industry in Hamburg impacted the startup scene?</strong> </p><p>We have lots of tech and media companies, making Hamburg a fertile breeding ground for people. The AdTech sector in Hamburg is probably more established that in Berlin and I think the traditional industry is the reason for that. I think we have a world class AdTech sector. </p><p><strong>Given that Hamburg is a smaller ecosystem than Berlin, is German necessary to succeed in the city?</strong></p><p>No, I don’t think it is necessary to speak German. Hamburg is not like Berlin Mitte, where English is the first language and where Spanish and Italian are fighting for the second position, but there are certainly lots of people in Hamburg who get by only speaking English. We have a lot of employees in the company who only speak English. In my  companies during the past 10 years more than 50% have spoken no German. And nobody ever complained about not getting by in Hamburg, which has a long international history due to it being a harbour  The German-focus is a stereotype and I think it has to do with the lack of awareness internationally of how great Hamburg is as a city.</p><p><strong>Why did you found Qype in Hamburg and not Berlin?</strong></p><p>You have to put Qype in perspective. I started working on that in 2005 and the main push was in 2006. At that time, Germany was very different. There was not much of a Berlin ecosystem, apart from maybe the Samwer brothers, having left the woods near Potsdam with eBay and starting their own company in Mitte. We had a couple of large internet companies in Hamburg (Parship, Xing was already a success), while Munich was still the top destination for US  tech companies like Expedia. </p><p>Similarly, finding money for something new was very very difficult. We didn’t have many meaningful German VCs, probably around five, four of which were in Munich and one in Hamburg. So there never really was this stark choice between Hamburg and Berlin. In fact, I had to travel a lot and in the end I got French and English investment and only three years later I got German money. For me, the early years of Qype were very much between Hamburg, London and Paris, first to get funding and secondly to make sure we cover my most important markets - UK, Germany and France. </p><p><strong>Was it difficult to recruit international talent to join Qype at that time?</strong> </p><p>At the time, we recruited people from France and the UK into leading positions in Germany and yes it was quite difficult to get these people to Hamburg, as Hamburg was not that well-known at the time. Few people would have considered moving to Germany at all then, but I think that has changed a bit. Germany has become much more attractive. </p><p><strong>What are the most popular programming languages used by startups in Hamburg?</strong></p><p>Qype was one of the first companies in Germany to be built on Rails and I made that decision when we were on Rails 1.0 so it was a super risky decision - but a good one. Since then, a lot of development has shifted to Rails. I think it&#39;s hard to judge technology by geography, but in Hamburg, I feel there is still a relative shortage of good frontend developers - aside from the games sector of course.</p><p>One thing I can say about Germany more generally is that over the last ten years we have made gains on a core structural weakness - our historical lack of user experience designers. Outside of the dials of  car, Germany does not really have a good history of strong UX. In the US, whether you walk into a museum or onto a beach, there is always some sense of UX. Whereas in Germany it&#39;s much more common to see a sign telling you what not to do! I think that&#39;s a cultural thing. With this history, it is fantastic to see that both Berlin and Hamburg are developing a stronger skill base in UX design. </p><p><strong>Are there any startups operating in Hamburg which you are excited about?</strong></p><p>I tend to work in a tunnel when I work in my own startup. I like Deposit Solutions, a FinTech company I believe will do very well. Also, in our building we have an interesting company called TripRebel. I still think Wunder is a surprising company because they have managed in a terrible regulatory environment and they still do a lot of business. </p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about your most recent project FLIO and what you have planned next for the company?</strong></p><p>Airports are fantastic commercial opportunities, mostly in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, not so much yet in the US, where many airports offer much less choice. However, the time passengers spend at airports so far has been overlooked as an opportunity to support them with a great mobile product. </p><p>FLIO is offering exactly that - allowing users to gain instant WIFI access in airports, to access discounts and book lounges or trains and just generally have a more pleasant trip. You can see the full potential in the big airports: in Heathrow, Frankfurt, but we cover more than 900 airports. We are just at the beginning, with lot’s of work ahead for indoor mapping, integrating partners but mostly to streamline the user experience for past and future trips. </p><p> This will require a reasonable amount of work on the frontend side, but we have a lot of ambition. </p><hr>",

The natural tendency is to concentrate on one language. I don’t personally see that as a requirement - I think you can still have a clean code base irrespective of the number of languages. It comes down to having a solid engineering approach and a framework which is understood within the business. We have some elements being built in PHP and some in Java.

If I generalize we have two monoliths, but in reality we are breaking these systems into subsystems. It is service-orientated and it will tend towards a microservices architecture.</p><p>But I am reluctant with buzzwords like microservices. The danger is you head blindly towards a utopian vision. Microservices is still a trade-off; by simplifying the code you aren’t simplifying the system, you are moving the complexity from the code to the communication layer. Our approach is pragmatism. If we end up in a state where everything is microservice, then so be it. But it should be done because it&#39;s the right move, not simply because it&#39;s a hot topic currently.</p><h3 id='when-working-within-this-distributed-culture-how-do-you-ensure-your-engineering-teams-are-work-together-efficiently'>When working within this distributed culture, how do you ensure your engineering teams are work together efficiently?</h3><p>We work on building understanding among the teams about the technical and commercial vision of zanox. Once this is grasped, we give them a lot of freedom to decide on which technology to use. We provide the framework but then encourage autonomy.</p><p>Thoughtworks has a great idea of Tech Radar, in which they talk about the technologies they have been using and why they are happy with them. We operate in a similar way: first level is core systems technology, next level is non-core systems technology and finally there are technologies that we don’t want included at all. PHP and Java are core technologies, for example. C/C++ are technologies we are trying to make redundant. But the second level is the most exciting - in there we are playing around with a lot of different things.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/zanox-office.png' alt='zanox overview'></p><h3 id='are-there-any-particular-technologies-that-your-engineering-team-has-been-exploring-that-you-are-particularly-excited-about'>Are there any particular technologies that your engineering team has been exploring that you are particularly excited about?</h3><p>Certainly around the messaging side – we were an early adopter of Kafka. That has become a core part of our tracking stack. Around NoSQL/Big Data, we are trialling a number of technologies, including Hadoop, H-base, MongoDB. Most of those are becoming established parts of the system. On the frontend there is still some exploration – we are using Angular, but now some of the teams are questioning that. We are exploring alternative frameworks, such as React. It&#39;s all about trial and error!</p><h3 id='how-much-coding-do-you-still-get-to-do-as-cto'>How much coding do you still get to do as CTO?</h3><p>Everyone has this fear that as they move towards management, they will become less hands on. And that’s fully justified. The truth is, as CTO, by continuing to contribute to the code base you are actually hampering the business. You time is required elsewhere.</p><h3 id='do-you-apply-an-agile-management-approach-across-the-whole-company'>Do you apply an agile management approach across the whole company?</h3><p>Yes, this is something I am proud of - how organizational culture within the company has been driven from the tech side of the business. I think both Affiliate Window and zanox were early adopters of Agile and Scrum. We now have this concept of Lean Delivery Agents, who are there to facilitate the development teams and get shit done. Teams are free to choose – most use Kanban, some use Scrum.</p><p>I think what’s been really interesting is how these concepts are promoted and applied within the wider business. The idea of facilitation is really strong. 90% of the time we are working on new things, so we shouldn’t get wound up when it isn’t perfect. The idea is to use the feedback loops and the retrospectives and whatever artefacts provided by Agile to facilitate constant movement.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/zanox-office-berlin.png' alt='zanox berlin'></p><h3 id='as-a-self-taught-programmer-yourself-what-attitude-does-zanox-have-towards-hiring-developers-with-no-academic-background-in-computer-science'>As a self-taught programmer yourself, what attitude does zanox have towards hiring developers with no academic background in computer science?</h3><p>The tendency is always to go for people with a degree - which I don’t agree with. We are prepared to take people who are self taught. I am not dismissing computer science degrees, but I really love the idea of learning through experience. Coding is something that fits well into that whole idea of apprenticeships.</p><h3 id='many-engineers-are-promoted-because-of-their-technical-capability-but-this-can-be-problematic-as-technical-skills-dont-always-equate-to-managerial-skills-how-does-zanox-promote-developers'>Many engineers are promoted because of their technical capability, but this can be problematic as technical skills don’t always equate to managerial skills. How does zanox promote developers?</h3><p>Yes, typically what happens is companies will take their most experienced engineer and promote them into a management position. We do the same thing, but I am not fully convinced this is the right thing. You want a strong technical person who will have the respect of the engineers he is going to be leading, but also you are taking someone whose whole experience is around engineering and not people management necessarily. That can be a baptism of fire - it certainly was for me.</p><h3 id='how-are-zanoxs-engineering-teams-organized'>How are zanox’s engineering teams organized?</h3><p>We have 58 engineers across 10 traditional teams (five in Berlin, five in London), plus some developers working remotely. Each team has four or five engineers and a QA engineer. We also have a number of supporting teams, such as architecture, lean delivery, systems engineering, and product. Each of those departments offer support to the engineering teams.<img src='/assets/images/zanox-office_berlin.png' alt='zanox jobs'></p><h3 id='are-you-hiring-developers'>Are you hiring developers?</h3><p>We are hiring across the board. We have positions open for systems and enterprise architects, PHP, Java developers, expertise in any of the things we are using in our stack.

You are the one who will translate between the two sides of the business, so you have to have a very good understanding of both. To be a technical leader, you have to be able to describe and talk about what you do to non-technical audiences.</p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160603&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

Though generalisation has been key to progress the technological landscape is growing ever more vast and complex, ence the evolution of programming languages will turn T-rexes into chickens and scripts into full-stack. Looking at what is already up and coming, Rust is a language that works well where integrity is important in exposed environments, such as web browsers. Explicit object ownership contributes to keeping the client safe from hostile takeovers, though puts the team working with it through new hoops. Further, in high performance systems functional languages will be prevalent due to it is inherently guaranteed to run without side effects. I do not believe that object oriented languages like Java or C# will disappear, as they are easy to get started with (&quot;Build an app today!&quot;) and quite versatile after all, this puts them in the group of productive languages that find a way to survive even if they have to evolve. It is presumptuous to say that these type of languages will always be around, though it is difficult for someone who grew up with object oriented languages to imagine anything wiping them out.&#39; %}</p><p>Alvean is a Swedish and works as a Java developer working in a small team at a large corporation.

Currently I’m learning Swift, which has features common for functional programming languages, but yet it is not a functional language.Observing the evolution of languages, we can see that languages that were OO for so long, like Java and C++, are bringing FP features. Software development is not about being fanatic for a particular paradigm, it is about producing reliable software, and we can choose what to use, what helps us, in order to achieve that. I hope we can get best of both OO and FP paradigms and go hybrid.&quot; %}</p><p>Aleks has been an iOS developer since 2008 and is currently working as Mobile Engineer at SoundCloud.

As compilers and runtime environments become more complex, humans can be somewhat less precise about the programs they write. For example in academia, we learnt the fundamentals of computer science through older, lower level languages like C, where we had to be much more aware and explicit of the details of running programs. This entailed building of a more primitive type, managing memory usage, switching thread contexts, etc.Then with the emergence of popular dynamically typed languages like Javascript, Python, Ruby, etc, the runtime environment could take care of choosing how an object is represented in memory and other aspects, so that the programmer could focus on higher level details.Looking forward, I see this trend becoming only more prominent. Soon everyday hassles for programmers like concurrency and garbage collection will be completely abstracted away by runtime environments and virtual machines. This will also extend to code for &quot;connecting&quot; modules of programs together as well; hopefully the efforts needed to map database entries to objects, serializing and deserializing objects, and formatting in general will vanish.These languages will integrate a variety of programming paradigms with them; soon every language may have OOP-like qualities and functional programming-like qualities, and the programmer will have the flexibility to use each as he or she sees fit.&quot; %}</p><p>Kate was born in the USA.

To start, can you tell us the reason why you chose PHP as your main programming language? Did you ever consider moving to any other languages?</h3><p>I started to use PHP because I was interested in web development in 1998. Before I used Perl but PHP was more web-oriented. In fact it was invented for that. Since then PHP has grown a lot. PHP 7 shows the huge performance improvements that are possible, especially through new features like scalar type declarations. Even if there are good alternatives in the industry, PHP is still the main programming languages for the web, used by more than <a target='_blank' href='https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all'>80% of websites</a> worldwide.</p><h3 id='how-did-you-become-an-open-source-contributor'>How did you become an open source contributor?</h3><p>Since I was a young developer I have been sharing my code with friends, later I shared it on BBS, and finally on the internet. So I can say I was an open source developer from the beginning, even before the open source movement started. I think that being an open source developer is a cultural attitude rather than a license agreement. Sharing code to improve knowledge is still my biggest motivation.</p><h3 id='you-work-for-zend-what-are-the-pros-of-being-an-open-source-developer'>You work for <a target='_blank' href='http://www.zend.com'>Zend</a>, what are the pros of being an open source developer?</h3><p>The pros are huge! As developer you can share your ideas and code with millions of great developers worldwide and I think this is the best satisfaction for any developer; I feel very honored and privileged for this opportunity. We have about 700 contributors to the Zend Framework alone. Because your code is used by such a big audience you can impact and guide the development of technologies. For example, we started in 2006 with OOP best practices and we were one of the first PHP frameworks to offer the MVC architectural pattern.</p><h3 id='what-are-the-biggest-cons-of-being-an-open-source-developer'>What are the biggest cons of being an open source developer?</h3><p>I would say that we also have big responsibilities. We need to be careful when you release something, especially for backward compatibility. As uncle Ben said in Spiderman: &quot;With great power comes great responsibility!&quot;</p><h3 id='how-do-you-handle-remote-work'>How do you handle remote work?</h3><p>Working remotely is absolutely awesome! I have worked remotely from Italy for a company based in Cupertino (California) since 2008. I can manage my time better, balancing between company and family needs. I can only do this because Zend Technologies has a good remote working culture. Many of my colleagues are remote workers and the company gives us all that we need to work remotely.</p><h3 id='what-are-the-challenges-of-working-remotely'>What are the challenges of working remotely?</h3><p>The only thing that I&#39;ve recognized is that remote working is not an easy process, you need to practice and have a good mentor. For instance, the best advice that I received was to have a dedicated computer only for work with a little space to manage the difference between personal life and job. If you have a dedicated room use it as your office, and remember close the door when you finish to work!</p><h3 id='you-cooperated-on-some-books-about-best-practices-on-php-and-javascript-and-you-also-gave-a-tedx-talk-in-your-opinion-what-is-the-best-way-to-communicate-when-it-comes-to-technology'>You cooperated on some books about best practices on PHP and Javascript and you also gave a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SienrLY40-w'>TEDx talk</a>.

TEDx is a great channel to present ideas and inspiring talks; I gave a presentation about creative coding and it was an awesome experience. Also writing a blog post or a book is a great way to talk about technology. I really like self-publishing <a target='_blank' href='http://www.zimuel.it/books/'>e-books</a> because they give the author the possibility to easily update the book and give previews of some chapters.

Today, we can definitely bet that this technology will continue for many years thanks to the incredible performance improvement and the new features of PHP 7. For instance, recently badoo.com, the largest dating network in the world, saved more than <a target='_blank' href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/216377/verona_php_2.pdf'>$1 million moving to PHP 7</a>.</p><p>Grazie Enrico!</p><hr>",

Why is there such a big difference between the salaries and demand of each programming language? Well, it’s more or less question of supply and demand: Scala is this “sexy” new language - very popular, but Scala developers are rare. Therefore companies are willing to pay extra to secure a Scala programmer. </p><h3 id='top-companies-looking-for-scala-developers'>Top Companies looking for Scala developers</h3><p><a target='_blank' href='https://wire.com/'>Wire</a></p><p>Industry: Internet</p><p><em>“Modern, private communications”</em></p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.eyeem.com/'>EyeEm</a></p><p>Industry: Photography</p><p><em>“Find New Perspectives - License authentic, royalty-free images from the world’s leading photo community”</em></p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://soundcloud.com/'>Soundcloud</a></p><p>Industry: Music</p><p><em>“SoundCloud is the world’s leading social sound platform where anyone can create sounds and share them everywhere”</em></p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://relayr.io/'>Relayr</a></p><p>Industry: Information Technology &amp; Services</p><p><em>“The “Internet of Things” is happening now - Relayr accelerates your digital transformation.”</em></p><p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.applift.com/'>AppLift</a></p><p>Industry: Internet</p><p><em>“Unite your mobile marketing with DataLift 360 - One solution.

PHP is great, PHP is useful, it’s been around for years - and it does the job. You might say there is an abundance of PHP developers available to companies - which is both good and bad.

      "contents": "<p>Michael Kugele has been involved in the Berlin startup scene for more than 15 years, joining as a developer in the early days of both Rocket Internet and Project A Ventures. Today Kugele is CTO at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.nu3.com/'>Nu3</a>, where he is responsible for a team of 10 developers, 6 quality assurance engineers and 4 product managers.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/nu3-box.png' alt='nu3-box.png'></p><h3 id='how-has-the-berlin-startup-scene-changed-over-the-past-15-years'>“How has the Berlin Startup scene changed over the past 15 years?”</h3><p>Around the time when I got involved with the startup ecosystem here in Berlin, it was pretty young - there was no Project A, no Rocket Internet. There was no startup ecosystem and only a handful of <em>“sexy”</em> startups for developers to work at.</p><p>I guess the whole boom started in eCommerce. Back then nobody knew how eCommerce worked. When Rocket Internet started Zalando it used an out-of-the-box system from a hosting provider for €15 per month. There were sales but no one really knew how eCommerce worked in general. Developers had no clue about it. There was also no information about online or performance marketing. It was new to everybody.</p><p>Now, 10-15 years later, those skills are more abundant and the number of startups in general has exploded. Developers have the opportunity of going anywhere they like. The most dramatic change has been the fight for talent, which is somehow problematic.</p><h3 id='what-is-it-like-working-as-a-developer-in-incubators-and-accelerators'>“What is it like working as a developer in incubators and accelerators?”</h3><p>Well I guess it depends. About four to five years ago Rocket Internet was different compared to now - it was more like an incubator; early stage investment, bootstrapping companies etc. This can be really interesting for developers as it’s very agile, but it can also be very unstable and changing day to day.</p><p>Returning to Rocket Internet it’s no longer a startup - it’s a huge company and they have a lot of processes. I guess nowadays they have these templates for how to build companies - which is no fun because it’s more like copy/paste.</p><p>What they demand of their developers is different too. Now they need these nine to five developers doing their job being “code drones” as we call them. They are doing their job, following ticket entries, but they are not involved in product development anymore.</p><h3 id='how-is-the-nu3-engineering-team-structured'>“How is the Nu3 engineering team structured?”</h3><p>The team currently consists of ten developers which are divided into three teams, two of which work in scrum and one which is our firefighting team which works in a more scrum-ban way. It is a smaller team, but it’s good because they can work on smaller projects involving less planning like bug fixes and more ad hoc things.</p><p>In the past I have tried keeping a clear separation between frontend and backend developers, but now I want to really educate a frontend guy to know how to do backend stuff and the other way around. I guess right now we pretty much have fullstack developers. Of course you have preferences - backend or frontend - that’s normal, but technically you could work on both sides.</p><h3 id='what-tech-stack-is-nu3-currently-using'>“What tech stack is Nu3 currently using?”</h3><p>We are currently using PHP as our main backend programming language, with Zend, Yii and Silex frameworks. On the frontend we mainly use pure Javascript.</p><h3 id='do-you-think-that-php-remains-the-industry-standard-for-ecommerce-in-berlin'>“Do you think that PHP remains the industry standard for eCommerce in Berlin?&quot;</h3><p>To a certain extent, yes. What you have to understand is how things have developed: Project A Ventures was founded by the former managing directors of Rocket Internet, and some of the members of Rocket Internet team followed the directors to Project A.</p><p>At Project A we were not allowed to use stuff that we built for Rocket Internet and this is why we created a new stack, which was based on the ideas and learnings that we had at Rocket Internet.</p><p>Back in the days Zend framework was state of the art. Over the last five years, there have been a lot of hyped frameworks but none of them really survived, you have to be confident in what you choose and how long it will survive.</p><p>This is why now, five and a half years later, Zend has still not been replaced even though it’s a bit outdated. But we are also working on extracting some components and going over to microservices, as the old applications don’t scale very well when it comes to larger stuff.</p><h3 id='microservices-seems-to-be-a-buzzword-these-days---is-it-the-solution-to-all-programming-problems'>“Microservices seems to be a buzzword these days - is it the solution to all programming problems?”</h3><p>Of course it isn’t! It solves problems, but it introduces new problems and you have to somehow decide what is more important for you. In our case, as our overall complexity is low, we can just extract the pain points from our system.</p><p>We extract step by step and learn, we don’t just do it right away and cut our application into ten different pieces. Smaller components, however, are easier to maintain and that’s very important to remember. You can try out new technologies with smaller services, if you find out this technology is wrong for you, you just replace it.</p><p>If the API is constant - it’s well-defined, and if you really thought about it properly - you can exchange everything on the backend and the services just continues working as it was working before, so this makes it flexible and you can adapt to new technologies easier.</p><h3 id='are-you-hiring-developers-at-the-moment-and-which-qualities-are-you-looking-for-in-a-top-developer'>“Are you hiring developers at the moment? And which qualities are you looking for in a top developer?”</h3><p>Yes, we want to increase our speed, so we will also increase the size of our team. And in terms of a top developers we’re not so interested in the syntactical stuff and how they write the code, but rather their approach to solving logic problems. Coding is the easy task - just to translate from the plan to the source code.</p><p>I don’t want to sit next to a guy to see how he’s coding. I like to see whether these guys know about the complexity of the code they are writing or whether he’s Googling for six hours to find out the right solution. You can teach somebody to write code, but you can’t teach somebody how to use their brain.</p><h3 id='considering-both-hr--product-what-are-the-goals-of-nu3-for-the-year'>“Considering both HR &amp; product, what are the goals of Nu3 for the year?”</h3><p>We are looking into this “half a day off per week” approach to increase idea generation. It means each team would get half a day of dedicated time per week to come up with fancy stuff. Usually they are working on a project that has particular business value or at least it’s assuming that there is a business value behind it. The idea is to introduce these hack sessions so they can get creative without any pressure of business value or goals.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, we want to increase the headcount, just to be able to focus more on infrastructure and to get rid of this legacy code and architecture and generally be prepared for the growth of the company. If we would double the order amount our system must be prepared in a way that it can handle it. I would say this would be the project for the next half year and then maybe the following six months would be spent coming up with a proper mobile solution because this is going to be even more important.</p><hr>",

We receive constructive feedback from developers about various recruiting process on a daily basis. We have picked our seven most frequently occurring points, which can help you improve your tech recruitment, today!</p><h2 id='1-structure-your-interview-process'>1. Structure your interview process</h2><p>Streamlining your interview process is the first, crucial step towards improving your overall hiring rate. First, you will need to consider whether the interview focuses on culture fit or hands-on skills matching for the new job role. Having a “question bank” of go-to questions is a good way of ensuring consistency. These questions should be worked into the conversation in a natural way, always bearing in mind the knowledge you have about the candidate. Scorecards as a tool for assessing and categorising candidates are also a great way of reminding yourself why this candidate appealed to you in the first place. As an added benefit, having a more structure approach to recruitment will help candidates understand procedures and what to expect, which is super helpful for those who need a little help calming their interview nerves.</p><h2 id='2-use-work-sample-tests--instead-of-a-coding-challenge'>2. Use work sample tests  instead of a coding challenge</h2><p>If you are struggling with developers who are not so keen to take your coding challenges, consider creating a work sample test. Take your application, remove a part of code responsible for a specific feature (eg. search filter) and let candidates work on it. This way they can learn about your product and picture what kind of work they would do for you. Furthermore, avoid sending tests before speaking to the developers - they also want to get to know you, before they invest time in your task!</p><h2 id='3-share-feedback-in-a-timely-manner'>3. Share feedback in a timely manner</h2><p>Developers should receive clear, structured feedback on their performance during both the interview and coding challenge. Thanks to your feedback candidates can improve in the future and will consider your company a solid partner. Most importantly, your feedback should arrive on time! If you promised one week - do it in one week. If you are unable to keep this promise - let them know what is going on. </p><h2 id='4-focus-on-potential-not-experience'>4. Focus on potential, not experience</h2><p>Keep in mind that everyone has weaknesses. Your interview process should focus on the developer’s strengths and ability to learn new things, rather than weaknesses and mistakes made. To learn more about your candidate’s workflow process and to see how they are getting on, don’t be afraid to ask them questions about which elements they have been working on so far.  It will be easy to spot smart people. </p><h2 id='5-speed'>5. Speed</h2><p>Speed is crucial if you are searching for senior developers. They will definitely be talking to  other companies and in the end, it’s up to you to convince them to choose yours. Keep in mind that the longer you hesitate the lower the chances are for a successful hire. Make all your team members aware of how important recruiting is and find a way for them to devote a few hours per week to it. This way it will become much easier to align schedules and fix the interviews. </p><h2 id='6-involve-non-tech-team-members'>6. Involve non-tech team members</h2><p>Having troubles evaluating the culture fit? Involve non-tech team members in the interview process. Your online marketing team works closely with the tech team? Have on OM Manager join the interview and talk about the challenges. What also works really well is a trial day, although  these are pretty hard to organize if you hire someone from overseas. </p><h2 id='7-be-considerate'>7. Be considerate</h2><p>If you do hire someone from overseas - be considerate. These candidates are moving their lives (and often families) to join you in your adventure. Address their needs and concerns and support them in the best way possible. </p><p>I hope these points raised by developers on Honeypot will help you improve your recruiting process.

In traditional setups,  HR functions include <strong>recruitment, compliance training, career development, risk management, and performance management.</strong> A large emphasis is also put on compliance and administration, particularly keeping to budgets.  </p><p>In this setup, success is measured through recruiting a particular number of people within a defined budget. It is argued that these metrics are often manipulated, with people motivated to fill roles rather than to find the best candidate for the right position. Further, the focus on cost efficiency is being judged as coming at the cost of flexibility and innovation. </p><p>In contrast, Employee Experience focuses on three main areas: <strong>culture, technology and organizational design.</strong> Payroll and admin are being separated from the main function, so as not to complicate the relationship between Employee Experience teams and the employees. </p><p>Topics covered can range from compensation and engagement to people analytics, workplace design, and well-being.  Many of the changes have been inspired by design thinking and behavioural psychology, all with the ultimate aim of creating a workplace people actually want to show up to. </p><p>The changes are being supported by more tech-orientated HR teams, who rely on multiple tools, like modern ATS systems (e.g <a target='_blank' href='https://www.lever.co/'>Lever</a>), recruiting platforms (e.g <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/for_employers?utm_source=EX'>Honeypot</a>) and employee happiness tools (e.g <a target='_blank' href='https://peakon.com/'>Peakon</a>)), rather than clunky legacy systems.

The term, which dates back to the 90s, with the rise of AJAX and multi-device rendering concerns, remains contested by many. And while the role does have its place, the term itself needs a serious update. Its time to say hello to the generalist developer. </p><!-- Main image --><h3 id='who-is-a-fullstack-developer'>Who is a fullstack developer?</h3><p>The definition of a fullstack developer in itself is subjective. To generalise, a fullstack developer is someone who works both on the presentational side of software and the computational side. In web development a fullstack developer usually works on frontend and backend concerns of a website. Back in the 90&#39;s to mid-2000&#39;s web developers were synonymous with fullstack developers. As most web projects consisted of simple user interfaces generated solely by servers, it was not uncommon to have all concerns handled by servers. It meant most developers had to know how to work with backend tasks as well as frontend-related issues. So, what has happened since then?</p><h3 id='enter-javascript-frameworks-and-handheld-devices'>Enter JavaScript frameworks and handheld devices</h3><p><img src='/assets/images/device-browser-usage.png' alt='Global OS Usage chart 2008-2016'></p><p>From the mid-2000&#39;s, a myriad of phone and tablet devices were introduced. This coincided with the rise of JavaScript frameworks, dealing solely with frontend presentation, which was a result of a new and exciting technique called AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript &amp; XML). Instead of web servers taking requests and returning a full rendered web page, a page could query for specific information and update the relevant presentational part. This meant faster websites (you only request what you need when you need it) and a new approach to web technologies. A new stack was introduced.</p><p>Phones and tablets brought with them an interesting concern to web development. Previously, websites were limited to personal computers, paying no attention to different screen sizes. The advent of phones and tablets called for a re-think on how web information was presented and consumed. This also added a new concern to the frontend side of things.</p><h3 id='the-myth'>The myth</h3><p><a target='_blank' href='http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html'>There</a> <a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/'>are</a> <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/extraface/status/476834118584377345'>plenty</a> of non-believers when it comes to the presence of fullstack developers in the modern development era. These concerns are understandable. Compared to pre-AJAX web, there are variety of concerns for one to master. Fullstack now involves:</p><ul><li>Frontend<ul><li>Design splicing and implementation</li><li>Responsive web implementation</li><li>JavaScript<ul><li>API integration</li><li>Framework (or vanilla.js) implementation</li><li>Performance optimization</li><li>Unit testing</li></ul></li><li>Miscellaneous<ul><li>Task runners</li><li>Accessibility</li><li>Different CSS/JS framework knowledge</li><li>Behavior testing</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Backend<ul><li>General backend model implementation<ul><li>Authentication/Authorization</li><li>API design</li></ul></li><li>Database<ul><li>Database design</li><li>Query optimisation</li><li>Data indexing</li></ul></li><li>Miscellaneous<ul><li>Data analytics (Big Data tools)[^1]</li><li>Unit tests</li><li>Isomorphic Rendering</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>DevOps<ul><li>Continuous Integration</li><li>Load Balancing</li><li>Caching</li><li>Virtualisation</li><li>Server security</li><li>Smoke tests</li></ul></li></ul><p>All the above, plus a multitude of other business specific requirements[^2] are the concerns of 2016 regarding fullstack developers. A frontend or backend developer will be able to master their relevant concerns, but it is almost impossible to find a fullstack developer capable of mastering both. However, that is not to say a developer is incapable of knowing and understanding all the concerns listed above.</p><h3 id='the-reality'>The reality</h3><p>Fullstack development is mostly limited to small teams with smaller-focused products. This means that a developer who is familiar with one stack would rarely possess the same knowledge on a variety of stacks. In comparison a backend developer would typically posse the same level of mastery on two or more server languages. As a matter of fact, most small companies require fullstack developers, meaning developers who are equally comfortable on the frontend and backend.</p><p>On the other side, most frontend or backend developers are to some extent fullstack developers, when we use this definition. After all, a lot of frameworks extract away the nitty-gritty parts of development, allowing us to focus on product delivery. Ironically, it is equally hard to find a developer who is unfamiliar with the stack that is not their specialisation.</p><h3 id='the-perks-and-costs-of-being-a-fullstack-developer'>The perks and costs of being a fullstack developer</h3><p>Aspiring fullstack developers should understand that the title is almost an oxymoron in today&#39;s development. It is much more sensible to aim towards being a well-rounded developer, and with time, and by extension experience, developers end up acquiring knowledge on how the other side works. However, developers with enough knowledge to dive on both stacks are in more demand as far as web development is concerned. They might not have similar knowledge in the frontend compared to a frontend developer, but they are comfortable enough to deliver a final product, and in most cases, that is good enough.</p><h4 id='perks-of-a-fullstack-developer'>Perks of a fullstack developer</h4><p>As stated previously, fullstack developers enjoy a lot more opportunities compared to a developer specializing in one stack. Most companies would prefer someone as comfortable dealing with CSS edge-cases as they are dealing with odd database queries.</p><p>Software tend to become a lot more challenging and equally rewarding when dealing with both ends of the stack. It is much harder to be bored when you have twice as many features and bugs to work on. Keeping in mind most fullstack developers work in small teams, product ownership seems to come almost naturally. </p><p>Some fullstack developers will go as far as having two different resumes, one for each stack, when applying for positions. In a way this maximises their chances of a getting the gig, but it might be tricky for some considering most fullstack developers tend to have a preferable stack when applying for positions.</p><h4 id='costs-of-a-fullstack-developer'>Costs of a fullstack developer</h4><p>Fullstack development means dealing with context switching on a daily basis. The mentality of frontend development is not the same as that of a backend development. This often leads to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/4oki3a/a_full_stack_developer_is_a_developer_who_can/'>introduction of bugs</a>. It is almost unavoidable when the job involves working with technologies with different priorities. With Node.js, it might reduce some programming language syntax errors, as far as context switching is concerned, but the different environment requirements are still there.</p><p>A lot of software development involves keeping up to date with the <a target='_blank' href='http://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/'>latest frameworks</a> and techniques. To a fullstack developer, this means double the amount work for their immediate stack. That does not include picking up new stacks altogether.</p><p>Compared to frontend development, backend developers have a significantly wider choice in technologies. A fullstack developer tends to be experienced in only a couple of technologies, and the task of mastering several programming languages becomes harder with frontend development in mind. While they might be able to apply to several positions, it becomes harder to standout when job opportunities demand highly specific domain knowledge[^3].</p><p>There are large tech companies who will outright not hire a fullstack developer. They require specific domain knowledge and would prefer someone with enough experience dealing with edge cases. Statistically, these jobs are less common but tend to be more on the bleeding edge of software development.</p><h3 id='final-thoughts'>Final thoughts</h3><p>The old definition of a fullstack developer is almost extinct, and it is much better to refer to them as generalist developers. The best way to become one is by focusing on one stack early in your career, while slowly picking up knowledge on the other stack. It is almost futile to aspire mastering both stacks, as the amount of information grows exponentially with each additional stack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[^1]: Data science and/or big data is a can of worms on its own</p><p>[^2]: A back-end developer for a video-content site will have different requirements to one working on a photo-sharing product.

And if you’re a dev reading this, now you know what to expect - you’re welcome. The 12 questions below serve as a starting point for a general, non-technical interview of DevOps candidates. Feel free to build and test your own (yes, that’s a DevOps joke!)</p><h2 id='12-common-devops-interview-questions'>12 Common DevOps interview questions</h2><h3 id='1--what-are-the-top-devops-tools-and-which-ones-have-you-worked-on'>1.  What are the top DevOps tools? And which ones have you worked on?</h3><p>Let’s start super basic. Here are some of the top DevOps tools and their function: </p><p><strong>Git</strong> - used as a source code management tool, and for tracking the progress of remote teams and open source collaborators.<strong>Gradle</strong> - using gradle scripts tasks can be automated throughout the building, testing and deployments stages. <strong>Kubernetes</strong> - “is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications. It’s a useful tool for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.”<strong>Selenium</strong> - is an automated testing framework. It can be made to test web applications automatically. <strong>Jenkins</strong> - DevOps teams use Jenkins to speed up production by automating a sequence of actions in the building, testing and deployment phases. <strong>Puppet</strong> - this configuration management tool helps to automate inspecting, delivering and managing software. <strong>Ansible</strong> - Ansible is the simplest way to automate apps and IT infrastructure. Application Deployment + Configuration Management + Continuous Delivery<strong>Chef</strong> - another configuration management tool.<strong>Docker</strong> - works to ensure a stable environment across all stages of development, from staging to production. </p><h3 id='2--how-do-you-define-devops'>2.  How do you define devops?</h3><p>DevOps is a fairly new discipline, and being so young there is often a muddle of opinions around what a DevOps engineer actually does. The candidate may have a different perspective on the role than yourself. Make it clear to yourself prior to the interview what roles and duties you want the candidate to be able to perform. In the interview, ask them to define what the role means to them. When they elaborate on the various roles and responsibilities, you’ll get a pretty clear picture of the candidates capabilities, and if they match what you’re looking for. </p><h3 id='3--are-there-any-limitations-to-the-application-of-devops-in-companies-of-different-sizes'>3.  Are there any limitations to the application of DevOps in companies of different sizes?</h3><p>From the beginning, DevOps has been something startups and smaller companies have adopted to scale. The leading argument for this has been that a lean and agile methodology would not be applicable on a larger scale. Thus, the quick answer to this might be “no.” However, a candidate with a broader understanding of DevOps may note that large corporates, from Toyota to Motorola to L’Oreál, have begun to fully embrace an agile work approach and taken up DevOps.</p><h3 id='4-whats-your-experience-with-the-tools-chef-puppet-ansible-and-salt'>4. What’s your experience with the tools Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Salt?</h3><p>The palette of tools and skills available to DevOps is extensive, and naturally personal preferences and work experience have a great impact on the specific skillsets of individual DevOps engineers. However, there are certain tools, with which all DevOps engineers ought to be familiar: Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Salt.These are all tools enabling the scalability of server configuration and management through automation, which allows the orchestration of hundreds - even thousands of servers. Of course, not being an expert in all tools doesn’t mean you don’t have a great DevOps engineer on your hands - but if they have no experience with at least one of them, your spider senses should be tingling.</p><h3 id='5-what-is-your-experience-with-continuous-integration'>5. What is your experience with continuous integration?</h3><p>Continuous integration is a key element of DevOps, as it refers to the process of continually merging the source code of all developers in a team, which enables the detecting and fixing of any mismatches and errors at an early stage. This encourages alignment before continuing with writing new code, which ultimately leads to a speedier, more responsive process.While the previous question addressed specific tools, this question relates to workflow processes, and there are many tools which may be used for continuous integration, including Travis, Jenkins, Bamboo, Circle and TeamCity.</p><h3 id='6-use-an-example-to-explain-what-a-vulnerability-is-and-how-and-how-it-may-it-be-prevented'>6. Use an example to explain what a vulnerability is and how and how it may it be prevented</h3><p>A vulnerability is a system flaw or weakness, which has the potential of being exploited by a hacker. It isn’t necessarily a security risk, as that would indicate a “loss”, rather it refers to any kind of asset (value or no value) that could be affected by an outside attacker.The perhaps best known example is the “Heartbleed” incident from 2014, where a security bug was inclosed in the OpenSSL cryptography library, which in summary meant up to half a million secure web servers - both servers and clients - were at risk of “buffer over-read” aka the potential theft of private keys, passwords and user session cookies.There are tools which can aid the detection of vulnerabilities but, however to truly prevent system flaws, careful system maintenance, best practices in deployment and auditing must be executed diligently. A good DevOps engineer should know this!</p><h3 id='7-which-development-and-infrastructures-mention-the-core-operations-of-devops-and-do-you-have-experience-with-these-tools'>7.

What’s the difference between Continuous Testing and Automation Testing?</h3><p>Automation testing is simply automating tests which were previously done manually. This can be done using various testing tools combined with scripts, so that tests are run automatically and without the need for manual intervention. Continuous testing is the action of continually carrying out automated tests throughout the development process. As each build is continuously tested, feedback from the business is exchanged so that problems and issues are identified quickly and before teams move into the next stage of production. Since feedback is provided along the way, developers can identify exactly where the issue(s) occur in production and fix them without having to rebuild the entire project. </p><h3 id='9-what-role-does-aws-serve-in-devops'>9. What role does AWS serve in DevOps?</h3><p>The answer to this question should be straightforward. Amazon Web Services is a secure cloud services platform offering database storage, unlimited computing power and other functionalities to help a business scale and grow. Using the cloud functionality, companies can create and release polished products and applications to the web. There are over 175 fully featured services inside of the AWS package, covering a wide range of technologies. You may want to ask the candidate if they have ever worked with other cloud platforms to see what infrastructure they might have handled in the past. Ask them about data projects they have been a part of, and what cloud services they leveraged to manage the project. </p><h3 id='-whats-the-difference-between-agile-and-devops'>. What’s the difference between Agile and DevOps?</h3><p>Most DevOps engineers expect this question as it’s fairly standard, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t helpful in understanding more about the candidate. There are many similarities which the candidate should identify, including Agile and DevOps methodologies. Ultimately you should hear that Agile helps with smoother production and development of software, while DevOps handles development and deployment of the piece of software - working towards maximum efficiency with faster productions, minimal errors and maximum reliability. </p><h3 id='11-whats-the-importance-of-devops-how-does-it-benefit-the-delivery-of-software'>11. What’s the importance of DevOps? How does it benefit the delivery of software?</h3><p>With everything going digital, the competition is becoming fierce. In order to keep up and stay relevant organizations must reinvent product deployment systems to allow for more flexibility with a robust design. This way they can adapt with the digital landscape.DevOps helps with this. A DevOps engineer can help streamline entire processes and promote mobility and agility to the production pipeline, starting with the core idea and ending with delivery to users. By implementing these streamlined processes, organisations can continually update and improve their products, staying competitive and flexible as the marketplace grows and adapts. </p><h3 id='12--overall-whats-the-most-important-thing-devops-helps-achieve'>12.  Overall, what’s the most important thing DevOps helps achieve?</h3><p>This question gets to the heart of the matter, and the candidate should be able to deliver a clear point. It should run along the lines of: the key thing DevOps will do for your organization will be to deliver faster updates into production with minimal risks helping your organization to achieve faster changes set in production without a lack of quality or an increase in risk. </p><p>That is the primary concept you want to hear from the candidate, however they may add other positives. For example; better communication and increased collaboration amongst teams. You will get a sense of the candidates experience in how precise and to the point the answer is. If they begin listing every benefit left-right-and-centre, it might show a lack of understanding on their part.</p><h2 id='8-top-tips-to-prepare-for-your-devops-interview'>8 Top tips to prepare for your devops interview</h2><p>This section is just for you, devs!</p><h3 id='1-note-your-successes'>1. Note your successes</h3><p>Identify what successes you have had working in DevOps, then make them relevant to the skills the company is looking for. Make sure to explain exactly why these ‘successes’ are by talking about the results and how they directly benefited the company. Was productivity increased? Was money saved? Did you create a better customer experience?   </p><h3 id='2-list-the-technologies-youve-used'>2. List the technologies you’ve used</h3><p>Make notes on why and how you used these technologies. It’s also a good idea to make notes on technologies you haven’t used before. The less in the dark you are the more prepared you’ll be should an unfamiliar question arise. </p><h3 id='3-research-the-company'>3. Research the company</h3><p>Find out everything you can about the company you’re going to interview with. The more you learn about the company the more you can understand what they are looking for. Having a sense of the general areas they are looking to improve will allow you to tailor your answers to their needs. It also shows interest if you can speak with confidence about the infrastructure details.</p><h3 id='4-talk-about-your-work'>4. Talk about your work</h3><p>The interview shouldn’t be the first time you talk about your work. Practice talking about your work with friends and colleagues. This’ll sharpen your points and make you more comfortable with the material. If you&#39;re job hunting, chances are you&#39;ll be going through a number of screenings. Use these calls to get in the habit of talking about what you do. Take note of what is most interesting to the caller, these will be helpful when preparing for the face-to-face interview.</p><h3 id='5-build-your-own-infrastructure'>5. Build your own infrastructure</h3><p>Building your own ‘dream’ infrastructure is a great way to showcase your work and gain confidence. You’ll learn how to solve more problems and adapt. </p><h3 id='6-solution-mindset'>6. Solution mindset</h3><p>Be aware, the interview won’t focus heavily on all the tools you know. Interviewers are well aware that a myriad of combinations exist, and instead want to see that you can approach problems with a solution mindset and see how you can learn and adapt to the specific needs of the company. </p><h3 id='7-dont-be-afraid-if-you-dont-know'>7. Don’t be afraid if you don’t know</h3><p>There are going to be tough questions asked - that’s a given. If you don’t know the answer that’s fine, admit as much, but don’t stop helplessly there. Instead, start brainstorming and work out a solution. Ask the interview questions about the issue to see if they give up some hints. Work through the question until you can figure out how to present a solution. It’s understandable to forget under pressure, but what will set you apart is that you don’t let that stop you from finding the answer. </p><p>That’s about it for now!

Considering DevOps is a relatively new term and job function in IT, there still seems to be some confusion among non-technical professionals as to what the role involves. This blog post gives a history of DevOps, provides a short comparison to System Admin, and finishes off with a glossary of DevOps terms.</p><h2 id='a-history-of-devops'>A History of DevOps</h2><p>The earliest mentions of DevOps date back to the 2008 Agile Conference and a talk on <a target='_blank' href='http://www.slideshare.net/littleidea/agile-infrastructure-agile-2009'>Agile Infrastructure by Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois</a>. At that time, businesses were experiencing problems with their tech infrastructure because the various departments weren’t effectively working together. Developers wrote code in isolation of the final product, which essentially meant that code often wasn’t compatible with the product environment. This caused a lot of problems in relation to deployment and bug fixes, which left System Administrators spread thin, and developers and product owners annoyed.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/what-is-devlops.png' alt='what-is-devlops.png'></p><p>Naturally this process was neither smooth nor efficient. The Agile movement first revolutionised the IT industry by increasing deployment frequency from one deployment every two to three weeks to 10 deployments per day. Since then, DevOps and Agile have kept pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and today companies like Amazon do several thousand deployments per day. In fact, Amazon are said to be doing one deployment every <a target='_blank' href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2971521'><strong>11.6 seconds!</strong></a>  </p><h2 id='what-is-a-devops-engineer'>What is a DevOps engineer?</h2><p>A DevOps Engineer is the person who knows the Software Development Lifecycle like the back of their own hand. They oversee code releases, and they were probably once a developer who became interested in network operations, or a system admin who wants to do more coding. Ultimately they turn ideas into reality.</p><h2 id='does-devops-replace-system-admin'>Does DevOps replace System Admin?</h2><p>There seems to be a common misconception that DevOps is merely System Admin repackaged, but with fancier tools. The stereotype goes: DevOps code, System Admins don&#39;t. In reality, it is fairer to say that there is a difference in focus between the two roles. System Admin is rather operative and maintenance, fixing things once they go wrong, while the focus of DevOps is automation through coding. </p><p>However, I must emphasise: System Admin shouldn&#39;t be replaced; the role is still very much needed. Errors will still occur, and System Admins are vital for daily operations and maintenance, and DevOps cannot and should not replace Ops people. Instead DevOps should be seen as the bridge to make the lives of developers and System Admins a lot easier. </p><h2 id='what-does-a-devops-engineer-do'>What does a DevOps engineer do?</h2><p>DevOps removes the incompatibility between development and product environments by creating code that automates and speeds up the tasks of System Admin. Previously System Admins had to complete lots of fixes, restructurings, deployments and small bits and pieces manually. </p><p>With DevOps, these things are automated and changes can be applied to all servers automatically rather than one-by-one manually. This means fewer tedious tasks and limitations for System Admin, allowing more time for server management and other maintenance tasks. For developers this means a better fit between the code they write and the actual product environment, therefore less rework and more time to focus on creating and developing. </p><p>At its best, DevOps improves workflow processes, infrastructure, and product performance through testing and fixing. Ultimately it’s faster time to market, improved response times, better scalability and a much nicer IT environment to work in. </p><h2 id='tools-that-devops-engineers-use'>Tools that Devops engineers use:</h2><p>So what tools do DevOps Engineers use? The absolute top buzzwords to look out for are Chef, Puppet, Salt and Ansible, which are all configuration tools. However, for a more detailed insight in keywords and tools, Honeypot has created the following glossary. Buckle up - it&#39;s gonna be a long ride!</p><h2 id='cloud'>Cloud</h2><h3 id='aws'>AWS</h3><p>“Amazon Web Services is a secure cloud service platform offering computer power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.”</p><h3 id='azure'>Azure</h3><p>“Microsoft Azure is a growing collection of integrated cloud services, analytics, computing, database, mobile, networking, storage, and web for moving faster, achieving more, and saving money.”</p><h3 id='google-cloud-platform'>Google Cloud Platform</h3><p>“Google Cloud Platform lets you focus on what’s next for your business.

The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell,’ a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.”</p><h3 id='perl'>Perl</h3><p>“Perl is the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages: powerful and adaptable. It was first developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working as a systems administrator for NASA in the late 1980s, as a way to make report processing easier. Since then, it has moved into a large number of roles: automating system administration, acting as the glue between different computer systems; and, of course, being one of the most popular languages for CGI programming on the web.” </p><h2 id='the-day-to-day-life-of-a-devops-engineer'>The day-to-day life of a DevOps Engineer</h2><p>There is no typical looking day for a DevOps Engineer. Differences in the role may vary when dealing with company size, culture, and existing work processes. Depending on the company culture, there can be pushback from people not wanting to change, this is when a DevOps might find themselves doing things outside of their job description. </p><p>Although, in a company that is proactive, a typical day will have a DevOps professional spending their time coding, testing, deploying, and retesting with various DevOps tools. Bugs will need fixing and time will be spent implementing processes in the teams to streamline development. On the social side of things, a DevOps engineer will have to ensure a culture of collaboration is maintained so that teams are working towards persistent improvement. </p><p>TL;DR - it’s a very important job.</p><h2 id='the-requirements-to-get-a-devops-job'>The requirements to get a DevOps job</h2><h3 id='educational-requirements'>Educational requirements</h3><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree (Most candidates have)</li><li>Certified DevOps Engineer certification through AWS (Fewer candidates have)</li><li>DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA) (Fewer candidates have)</li></ul><h3 id='proficiency-in-chef-puppet-ansible-and-salt'>Proficiency in Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Salt</h3><p>These are all tools enabling the scalability of server configuration and management through automation, which allows the orchestration of hundreds - even thousands of servers</p><h3 id='excellent-software-development-skills'>Excellent software development skills</h3><p>Everything you do as a DevOps engineer will rely heavily on the core skills of Linux, Python, and AWS (or alternate software) - proficiency in these is a must. Bear in mind, AWS has over a hundred services, knowing all these in and out is impossible, a DevOps engineer focuses primarily on the most common services and what’s essential for the product. Experience with Java, Python, and Groovy will also be necessary when it comes to design and implementation.Other relevant skills</p><p>Other relevant technical skills may include the following: Microsoft Server; Linux; Apache; Bash; and IP networking.</p><h2 id='what-is-a-typical-devops-engineer-salary'>What is a typical DevOps engineer salary?</h2><p>A DevOps engineer salary can vary greatly by years of experience and location.

He talks to Honeypot about trends in UI design, his role in TomTom’s navigation UI redesign and the many options available for developers in Amsterdam. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/tomtom-box.png' alt='tomtom'></p><h3 id='tomtom-is-a-rare-example-of-a-consumer-brand-that-has-emerged-from-europe-in-the-2000s-what-are-the-ingredients-for-its-success'>TomTom is a rare example of a consumer brand that has emerged from Europe in the 2000s. What are the ingredients for its success?</h3><p>The root of TomTom’s success lies with the four founders who started the company 25 years ago. In fact, TomTom is an excellent illustration of how long it takes to become successful as a startup! They are still highly committed to the company. </p><p>The product which made us famous about a decade ago is off-the market navigation; that brought map technology, navigation software and hardware thinking together in a single box, which was a very clever play. It required a lot of different skills and it&#39;s the biggest achievement TomTom made. </p><p>Combining the technology with a strong sales and marketing attitude, a good knowledge of the European customer and an association with the European automotive industry and you have the ingredients for TomTom’s success. </p><h3 id='what-impact-has-tomtoms-success-had-on-startups-in-the-netherlands'>What impact has TomTom’s success had on startups in the Netherlands?</h3><p>I think it&#39;s important that companies like TomTom and Phillips, exist in Amsterdam. It provides a good example to Dutch startups of how they could eventually grow. I think it&#39;s very motivating.</p><h3 id='the-netherlands-is-traditionally-strong-in-technology-what-is-it-like-for-developers-working-in-amsterdam'>The Netherlands is traditionally strong in technology. What is it like for developers working in Amsterdam?</h3><p>There are many options for developers in Amsterdam.  For developers who feel they need to make a career switch to touch more customers with their skills, it&#39;s also great to have a company like TomTom around. If you have the ambition to impact millions of people&#39;s lives, then it’s a good alternative to startups. </p><p>For companies, It&#39;s a tough landscape out there to attract and retain web developers and definitely for more specific technologies there is a real scarcity. Getting skilled, affordable talent is hard. </p><h3 id='how-many-software-developers-and-designers-work-at-tomtom'>How many software developers and designers work at TomTom?</h3><p>The design team at TomTom is about 40 people, including product designers, interaction designers, visual designers, user researchers and copywriters. They are largely focused on our consumer product line. Across the company, our engineering group has about 1000 engineers.  Those engineers are software, hardware and test engineers. </p><h3 id='that-is-a-small-group-of-designers-in-comparison-to-engineers-how-do-the-teams-interact'>That is a small group of designers in comparison to engineers. How do the teams interact?</h3><p>The majority  of TomTom software engineers work on low-level platform technology which does not have end user integration or involvement. Our map making requires a lot of engineering, especially around how you take the input from mobile mapping vans into map production. There is a lot of tool development and core technology development that doesn&#39;t require too much – if any - design focus. </p><p>Most of our designers work on frontend. Device UI, web sites and apps are covered by a subset of the engineering team and that&#39;s who the designers work closest with. As soon as there is a visible component or as soon as something is communicating with an end customer - UI on watches, apps, end-devices, companion apps - design enters. </p><h3 id='how-did-the-emergence-of-smartphones-impact-tomtom'>How did the emergence of smartphones impact TomTom?</h3><p>TomTom saw huge growth from 2005 to 2007, but then free maps and free navigation emerged. Maps basically became a free commodity. It was seen as a big threat but if you look at it in hindsight, it&#39;s not either or. Today you see people using  navigation on their phone, as built-in or as an after-market device. All of those three products have a lot of relevance.</p><h3 id='tomtom-is-contributing-hugely-to-the-development-of-autonomous-driving-what-are-the-technologies-behind-autonomous-driving'>TomTom is contributing hugely to the development of autonomous driving. What are the technologies behind autonomous driving?</h3><p>In the automotive space, we are a technology provider. The foundation of automated driving is very precise road condition information and maps are the core asset.  We are making true HD maps, with all the lane info, which helps an automated vehicle very precisely position itself on the road network and understand the situation ahead. Our technology brings the surroundings of the road into a 3D model. The mapping vans drive around, create a point cloud of the environment and we distill that point cloud into what we call HD maps and Road DNA. This allows the car to know and understand its surroundings precisely - information like the height of a bridge or the distance to a building.</p><p>On top of the HD map and the Road DNA, we build our navigation software, which functions in real time. We build navigation software which helps automated vehicles understand where they are, how they are positioned and where they should go and how they relate to other objects. That&#39;s a core foundation of the industry’s attempt to create automated driving. </p><p>Along with Google and HERE, we are one of three players in this field and that&#39;s incredibly exciting. HERE is now owned by a German consortium of car manufacturers, which opens doors for us with non-German carmakers.</p><h3 id='you-led-the-redesign-of-tomtoms-navigation-ui-this-must-have-been-a-huge-challenge-what-was-your-process'>You led the redesign of TomTom’s navigation UI. This must have been a huge challenge. What was your process?</h3><p>The redesign opportunity was one of the reasons why I joined TomTom.  From a UI point of view, the product had gone stale a bit. Four or five years ago, our product was very similar to other products in the market, we didn&#39;t have a unique identity or brand. At the same time, we also had a UI made for the navigation boxes. We needed to be able to transfer our UI to any product - to phones, to navigation devices, to cars and to all these frontends which have very different capabilities. </p><p>The challenge we faced was to define a user interface which could automatically morph itself to all those different frontends. What you see with responsive design on web today is what we did four or five years ago. We realized we could only move forward when our technology was unified - different products for different markets but all based on a similar flexible core.  We wanted to create a UI which was visually more honourable, less cluttered and more recognizable as as TomTom. </p><p>A group of four or five designers and me designed the base principles and did a lot of concept development, little prototypes, and designs on paper. We worked with a dedicated group of developers to test our ideas and see what worked and what did not. That then developed into a much bigger project which became the 4th generation of our navigation products. That is still the foundation of the products we ship today. </p><h3 id='what-is-the-core-of-tomtoms-navigation-ui'>What is the core of TomTom’s navigation UI?</h3><p>In the last four years, we added a lot of new features but the base is still the same - a UI that you don&#39;t have to touch while driving. A driving experience changes with context. If you are on the highway you can see far ahead, if you are in the city you get a closer view, if there is traffic you are informed, the whole UI is meant as TV watching, you should not have to take your hands off the steering wheel to get the info you need. </p><h3 id='what-do-you-see-as-the-biggest-trends-in-ui-currently'>What do you see as the biggest trends in UI currently?</h3><p>Designers are becoming much more technologically-aware. Customers get accustomed to new tech very quickly. For example in the early days of touchscreen technology, every mechanism had to be advertised. If you wanted to swipe up you needed a little up arrow to indicate what&#39;s possible. But if people pick up a device today they know how to use it.  Their behaviours have changed because of knowledge of interactions and expectations. Your customer will try anything with your product and you must be aware of that.</p><p>A designer today must be very knowledgeable of capabilities and limitations of the technologies the developer is working with. I think traditionally we’ve seen designers and developers live in their own worlds and now you see they are merging. Designers are learning basic coding and more advanced prototyping and live as much in JavaScript as in Photoshop. That&#39;s crucial to become and stay effective.</p><p>In our discipline, it&#39;s not just about the screen, we have to deal with a very constrained time factor. If you are running you can only look at your watch screen for two tenths of a second, so the information needs to be spot on. I think same in the car. It&#39;s a highly constrained context and that requires a certain mindset and skill. </p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160901&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>Amsterdam’s lifestyle is world famous. But how are the Dutch when it comes to building and scaling tech companies? And what is life like for software developers in Amsterdam? </p><p>To answer this question we gathered a sample of over 170 tech companies, classified them by industry and mapped them onto the city.  In previous editions of our <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/berlin-startup-map'>startup map</a>, we mapped the startups by train-lines. Given the influence of the humble bike on the Dutch capital, we took out the trains lines and surrendered to the streets. </p><p><a target='_blank' href='/assets/images/amsterdam-tech-map-2016-bigger.png'><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam-tech-map-2016.png' alt='Amsterdam tech map'></a></p><h5 id='click-on-map-to-enlarge'>Click on map to enlarge</h5><h2 id='tech-companies-in-amsterdam-an-overview'>Tech companies in Amsterdam: an overview</h2><p>According to <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>Compass</a>, there are <strong><em>between 1,900 and 2,600 tech startups</em></strong> in the Amsterdam-Startup Delta, the geographical triangle, which covers Amsterdam, the Hague and Eindhoven, including startup darlings like WeTransfer, TravelBird, and DoubleDutch. In addition, a number of international tech giants have made Amsterdam the centerpiece of their European strategy: Tesla, Facebook, and Google are just a few of the major tech companies in Amsterdam. </p><p>Over the last two years, the startup ecosystem has taken centre stage in Amsterdam, with mammoth efforts being made to coordinate public and private resources.</p><h2 id='kroes-kontrol'>Kroes Kontrol</h2><p>In 2014, Amsterdam brought in the big guns, appointing Neelie Kroes, the former European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, as Special Envoy for Startups. </p><p>Kroes is a formidable career political, a <a target='_blank' href='http://diginomica.com/2016/03/23/salesforce-driving-into-europe-on-kroes-control/'>board member of Salesforce</a>, and by all accounts a driving force in Amsterdam’s push to become a premier startup hub.</p><p>Kroes led the launch of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.startupdelta.org/'>Startup Delta</a>, an initiative with a very clear aim: to have Amsterdam ranking in a top three position in Europe on the <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking</a>. </p><p>Things seem to be going according to plan, as 2015 was the first year that Amsterdam ranked on the report. To get into the top 3 ranking, <strong><em>Amsterdam will have to replace either London, Paris or Berlin</em></strong>.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam6.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><p>Alongside Kroes, Kajsa Ollongren, Amsterdam’s deputy mayor of Economic Affairs, is an active supporter of both the tech community and the local arts scene.  This dual emphasis mirrors Berlin’s enigmatic former mayor, Klaus Wowereit, who once declared &quot;Berlin ist arm, aber sexy.&quot;  Ollongren rolled out <a target='_blank' href='http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/business/startupamsterdam'>StartupAmsterdam</a> in 2015, to attract IT talent and venture capital to Amsterdam. </p><h2 id='the-soft-power'>The Soft Power</h2><p>While Berlin has recently become the star of Europe’s startup scene, it is Amsterdam who has the stronger history of tech innovation. Long before startups became the focus, the Netherlands was renowned for digital innovation, producing multiple technological innovations which have changed the world, everything from the CD and DVD to WIFI and Bluetooth. </p><p>For developers, perhaps Amsterdam’s most noteworthy contribution is the Python programming language, which was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science. </p><p>Home grown, well established software and security companies, such as <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gemalto.com/'>Gemalto</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://xebia.com/about-us'>Xebia</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.avg.com/ww-en/homepage'>AVG Technologies</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.schubergphilis.com/'>Schuberg Philis</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomtom.com/'>TomTom</a> are a testament to that culture of innovation. In 2015, the Netherlands ranked 4th on the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/userfiles/file/reportpdf/GII-2015-v5.pdf'>Global Innovation Index</a>. More recent editions to Amsterdam’s portfolio include <a target='_blank' href='http://www.brightcomputing.com/'>Bright Computing</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://pyramidanalytics.com/'>Pyramid Analytics</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://wercker.com/'>Wercker</a>.</p><p>The legacy of digital innovation can be seen in the country’s superior technological infrastructure and the wealth of technical universities. Within an hour of Amsterdam, universities such as TU Delft, Utrecht University and TU Eindhoven, have research departments to rival the best in the world. </p><p>Being the country which invented WIFI, it should be no surprise that Amsterdam is home to the largest data transport hub in the world (Amsterdam Internet Exchange). According to the European Digital City Index 2015, Amsterdam has the second fastest mobile internet speed in Europe, with a 17.9Mb per second average speed. That compares to a 13.9Mb per second in Berlin. </p><p>The Netherlands’ infrastructure, combined with it the country’s excellent English language skills, proximity to European markets, and generous tax regime, have attracted larger international tech firms. In recent years, companies such as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.uber.com/'>Uber</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.teslamotors.com/contact'>Tesla</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://avazuinc.com/home/'>Avazu</a> have chosen Amsterdam as the centre of their European expansion. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.elastic.co'>Elastic</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.atlassian.com/'>Atlassian</a>, companies behind popular open-source, also have major offices in Amsterdam.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam9.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><h2 id='where-the-startups-started'>Where the Startups Started</h2><p>While technology has always been a strong point of the Dutch, Amsterdam’s modern startup scene started, arguably, with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.booking.com/'>Booking.com</a> in the late nineties. </p><p>Founded in 1996, Booking was one of the earliest internet based startups to find success in Amsterdam. Today it is one of the world’s most popular hotel reservations websites.  The company was formed when bookings.nl, founded by Geert-Jan Bruinsma, merged in 2000 with bookings.org, founded by Sicco and Alec Behrens, Marijn Muyser and Bas Lemmens. </p><p>The company was acquired by the Priceline Group for a mere $135 million in cash in 2005. For comparison, <a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/priceline-com-acquires-kayak-for-1-8-billion/'>Priceline bought Kayak</a>, a travel search engine, for $1.8 billion in 2012. The sale has been touted as one of the most profitable acquisitions in the digital travel industry in the 2000s, and points to one of Amsterdam’s less developed areas - financing.</p><h2 id='amsterdams-unicorns-and-startup-darlings'>Amsterdam’s Unicorns and Startup Darlings</h2><p>Following Booking, the second generation of startups began to emerge in the late 2000s. Startups such as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.adyen.com/'>Adyen</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.catawiki.com/'>CataWiki</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.wetransfer.com/'>WeTransfer</a>, began to demonstrate the innovative spirit of the Dutch startup scene.  </p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam5.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><p>Adyen launched in 2006 and today is one of the world’s largest payment providers, handling more than 250 payment methods, including credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and Bitcoin. Adyen processes <a target='_blank' href='http://uk.businessinsider.com/adyen-fintech-unicorn-payments-facebook-airbnb-spotify-wired-money-2015-7?IR=T'>$35 billion in payments annually</a> which equates to around two to three million payments daily. </p><p>CataWiki, which launched in 2008 as a site for comic-book enthusiasts, today focuses on auctions of &quot;exceptional items&quot;, such as classic cars. CataWiki has raised $94.83 million to date, with an estimated valuation hovering around $1 billion.  </p><p>WeTransfer, founded in 2009, is a large file-sharing tool and one of Amsterdam’s most-loved startups.  The company is particularly popular with designers due to its large homepage illustrations. WeTransfer secured <a target='_blank' href='http://www.startupdaily.net/2015/02/wetransfer-may-just-raised-25-million-way-monetised-free-users-makes-startup-really-interesting/'>$25 million Series A</a> round in 2015 from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.highlandeurope.com/'>Highland Capital Partners Europe</a>. </p><p>More recent successes from the city include <a target='_blank' href='https://travelbird.nl'>TravelBird</a> , a travel platform which raised $33.15M Series B in November, 2014,  <a target='_blank' href='http://doubledutch.me/'>DoubleDutch</a>, an event marketing software which claimed 2 million users by 2015,  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.treatwell.de/'>Treatwell</a>, a hair and beauty bookings marketplace, which was acquired in 2015 by Japan’s Recruit Holdings for <a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/wahanda-treatwell/'>$117 million</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.silk.co/product'>Silk</a>, a data visualization tool, which was purchased by big data provider Palantir in August 2016. One of the most exciting projects in the city is online supermarket,<a target='_blank' href='https://www.picnic.nl/'>Picnic</a>, which is taking a revolutionary approach to grocery delivery. The company has planned ambitious growth for it operations over the coming years. </p><h2 id='3d-printing-and-the-sharing-economy'>3D Printing and the Sharing Economy</h2><p>Amsterdam is known for its liberal and often brave experiments with new ways of living. It should come as no surprise then that it is pioneering new ways of sharing economy.  <a target='_blank' href='http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/2013/09/24/study-the-consumer-potential-of-collaborative-consumption/'>84% of Amsterdamers</a> said they would be willing to participate in the sharing economy. Following from the launch of the Startup Delta, in February 2015, Amsterdam launched its <a target='_blank' href='http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/2015/02/04/amsterdam-europes-first-sharing-city/'>Sharing City initiative</a>, connecting startups with corporates via city facilities. </p><p>Amsterdam-based local borrowing platform <a target='_blank' href='https://www.peerby.com/'>Peerby</a> showed the power of the sharing economy by raising $2.2 million over the course  of a weekend from 1051 crowdfunders through Dutch sustainable crowdfunding platform <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneplanetcrowd.com/en'>OnePlanetCrowd</a>. Hugo van der Spek, Head of Communications at the company, describes Peerby as a “laboratory in the sharing economy.”</p><p>Another highly innovative industry which is taking root in the city is 3D printing. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.3dhubs.com'>3D Hubs</a>, for example, are aiming to create the largest and fastest network of 3D printers.  <a target='_blank' href='http://www.shapeways.com/'>Shapeways </a>, an Eindhoven-founded, New York-based 3D printing marketplace claims to be the largest of its kind in the world. 3D Hubs have raised $11.5M in three rounds, with $7M being raised in the most recent Series B round, while the larger Shapeways has raised $76.3M in 5 Rounds from 7 Investors. </p><h2 id='amsterdams-startup-community--its-neighbours'>Amsterdam’s Startup Community &amp; its Neighbours</h2><p>Amsterdam has seen a spurt of self-organized initiatives which are driving the city forward. Irene Perk, a tech recruiter at <a target='_blank' href='https://usabilla.com/'>Usabilla</a>, explains that the startup community is already very strong, “Amsterdam is a tech startup city, it&#39;s full of creative entrepreneurs that are eager to help each other.”</p><p>It is not just Amsterdam which is driving Holland’s startup ecosystem. The whole region around Amsterdam, which includes Utrecht, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, The Hague, and other cities, is referred to as the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.startupdelta.org/hubs'>Startup Delta</a>.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam7.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><p>The region has produced a number of noteworthy startups. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.coolblue.nl/'>Coolblue</a>, one of Holland’s largest eCommerce shops is located in Rotterdam. </p><p>Co-working spaces and accelerator programs are popping up across the region. <a target='_blank' href='http://www.startupbootcamp.org/'>Startupbootcamp</a> runs an <a target='_blank' href='http://www.startupbootcamp.org/accelerator/e-commerce-amsterdam/'>eCommerce accelerator</a> in Amsterdam and a Hardware Technology accelerator (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.hightechxl.com/'>HighTechXL</a>) in Eindhoven. WeWork recently moved to Amsterdam, and The Next Web is also debuting its own highly curated tech space this October, coined TQ.</p><p>The startup ecosystem of the Netherlands is covered by some excellent media organizations. <a target='_blank' href='http://thenextweb.com/about/#gref'>The Next Web</a> , which launched in 2006 as a conference, has grown into a fully-blown media organization, pivotal in the European tech scene. <a target='_blank' href='https://startupjuncture.com/'>Startup Juncture</a> is well-regarded for its insight reports, while <a target='_blank' href='http://foundedinholland.com/'>Founded in Holland</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://siliconcanals.nl/'>Silicon Canals</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sprout.nl/'>Sprout</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://fd.nl/'>Fd.nl</a> and the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.dutchstartupdatabase.com/'>Dutch Startup Database</a> provide excellent resources for those looking to understand the scene. </p><h2 id='challenges-remain'>Challenges remain</h2><p>For all the success Amsterdam has seen over the last four years, it still has some way to go in two key areas: financing and talent. The Netherlands raised only about <a target='_blank' href='http://qz.com/483264/meet-the-woman-determined-to-turn-amsterdam-into-europes-silicon-valley/'>$793 million in venture capital</a> in 2014, while Germany and the UK raised $2.85 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.</p><p>The difficulties in raising early finance in the city are reflected in <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>funding statistics from the city</a>. However, while the average seed round is smaller for Amsterdam based companies compared to their European rivals ($450 - $500k versus $600 - 650k), in 2015, Series A tends to be more on par at approximately $5.5 million. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam4.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><p>The lack of  growth capital impedes entrepreneurial success, especiallywith regards to later-stage startups. John Staunton, founder of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.countrhq.com'>Countr</a>, a retail technology startup, agrees, noting it is rather difficult to raise the range between €1 to €3 million for startups in the local market.  </p><p>In the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ft.com/content/ede7b130-a54e-11e4-ad35-00144feab7de'>FT’s analysis</a> of Amsterdam’s startup scene, it commented, “Government support has helped increase the pool of business angels and seed funds that will typically put up to €1m in new businesses. Early-stage venture capital groups, such as HenQ and Newion, seek to make investments of up to €7.5m, but they are rarer.” </p><p>However, Roel de Hoop, a partner at Prime Ventures, a Dutch VC disagrees, noting that not only are London-based funds gaining interest, but the local scene is also developing, “There are a lot of new growth stage funds so there is more money available for later stage start-ups. Amsterdam has been investing for a long time in creating an attractive international start-up scene.” </p><h2 id='developers-needed'>Developers Needed</h2><p>While an increasing number of  talented junior developers  are graduating from the likes of <a target='_blank' href='http://www.tudelft.nl/en/'>Delft</a>, the largest technological university in the Netherlands, the tech shortage for senior positions remains a big challenge. </p><p>According to <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>Compass</a>, the proportion of developers with prior experience is lower than in other European startup hubs. Compeititon is fierce among employers for those developers with previous expereince,  especially given the resources of large tech companies such as Booking.com and TomTom. </p><p>For experienced developers, Amsterdam is loaded with opportunities. In an <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/whats-it-like-to-work-at-tomtom/'>interview with Honeypot</a>, Cees van Dok, Head of UX Design at TomTom,  noted &quot;There are many options for developers in Amsterdam. Companies like TomTom give a good alternative to startups.&quot; </p><p><img src='/assets/images/amsterdam8.png' alt='amsterdam tech map'></p><p>Compounding the scarcity of developers, bureaucracy around hiring can be difficult. Regulation makes it relatively hard to pay staff in equity, while hiring and firing can be costly and cumbersome compared to the US. </p><p>Visa issues are another tricky issue. <a target='_blank' href='https://usabilla.com/'>Usabilla</a>, for example, now has a team of 55 people, with 15 or so developers, and says the biggest challenge facing startups in Amsterdam is finding good technical people. Irene Perk, tech recruiter at the company, explains, “Since we are registered as a Highly Skilled Migrant employer, we have the possibility to hire outside the EU. This process can prove to be difficult as it is time consuming to acquire these developers.&quot;</p><p>Visas on average cost €850. Tim Gouw, creator of Founded Holland, notes that things are improving &quot;it was difficult to get a visa previously, but the startup visa has made it easier for developers to move to Amsterdam.&quot; Compounding this is the fact the number of foreign employees in the Amsterdam startup scene is <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>above the average</a> for comparative EU hubs. </p><p>Average salaries for developers in Amsterdam are pretty much on par with European averages, at around <a target='_blank' href='http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/'>$53,500 per year</a>. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=CTA-inline&amp;utm_campaign=amsterdam-tech-map'>Honeypot&#39;s</a> launch in the city aims to help alleviate the talent shortage, by bringing developers from across Europe together with Amsterdam tech companies. </p><h2 id='watch-out-berlin'>Watch out Berlin...</h2><p>With Holland’s excellent reputation for innovation, a passionate local startup scene and  some extra support from local authorities, Amsterdam seems well-placed to rival Berlin as Europe’s startup hub. Getting to that position will require a bigger injection of VC funding and a greater supply of talent. Nonetheless, Berlin should watch its back!  </p><h2 id='full-list-of-startups-and-technology-companies-in-amsterdam-and-the-startup-delta'>Full List of Startups and Technology Companies in Amsterdam

      "contents": "<p>Harry Roberts is an award-winning Consultant Front-end Architect who helps organisations and teams across the globe to plan, build, and maintain product-scale UIs. A Google Developer Expert, he writes on the subjects of CSS architecture, performance, and scalability at <a target='_blank' href='http://csswizardry.com/'>csswizardry.com</a>; develops and maintains <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/inuitcss'>inuitcss</a>; authored <a target='_blank' href='http://cssguidelin.es/'>CSS Guidelines</a>; and Tweets at <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/csswizardry?lang=en'>@csswizardry</a>.</p><h3 id='can-you-tell-us-about-the-history-of-the-blog-and-how-it-grew--in-popularity'>Can you tell us about the history of the blog and how it grew  in popularity?</h3><p>I registered the <a target='_blank' href='http://csswizardry.com/'>csswizardry.com</a> domain way back in 2007 as a little playground and blog of sorts. After a couple of years of doing not-that-much with it, I started blogging about new and upcoming CSS3 techniques which proved to be a real honeypot for attracting developers—very Google-friendly articles like ‘pure CSS dropdown menu’ began driving people to the site, and things slowly took off from there.</p><p>After a few more years, from 2011 onward, I began researching and blogging a lot more about CSS architecture and more substantial articles on managing CSS at scale, which is what I’m most well known for now.</p><h3 id='the-lines-between-css-and-javascript-are-getting-more-and-more-blurred-do-you-think-developers-should-write-css-in-javascript'>The lines between CSS and JavaScript are getting more and more blurred. Do you think developers should write CSS in Javascript?</h3><p>No. I don’t think writing your CSS in JS (as in some flavours of React, etc.) is a sensible idea. Doing this completely breaks the separation of concerns, meaning that our styles rely entirely on our choice of view library. Two previously unrelated parts of the stack are now completely combined with one another, which means that if we ever want to change our JS library, we have to change our CSS as well. We have put all of our eggs in the same proverbial basket.</p><h3 id='what-about-css-for-functionality'>What about CSS for functionality?</h3><p>No. The <a target='_blank' href='https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/'>checkbox hack</a> has given rise to lots of things implemented in ‘pure CSS’ that should actually be achieved with JavaScript. I think things that make things more complex than simple hovers etc. should be left to JS, rather than abusing incorrect elements to provide functionality that could have been done much more clearly with JaveScript.</p><h3 id='would-you-advise-using-css-for-animation'>Would you advise using CSS for animation?</h3><p>Yes. It used to be the domain of JS to provide any interactivity or movement, but animating and transforming things with native CSS is measurably faster. This is an area where things should tend more toward CSS. Instigating these animations might still be left to JS, but the animations themselves should be written in CSS.</p><p>To put it another way, I think that the actual process of moving something from state A to state B should be done by CSS, but there are a lot of things around that (When does the animation start? How does it start? When and how does it end? Is it an animation in response to something else that’s happened on the page?) which should be achieved using JS.</p><p>In addition to this, the Web Animations API provides a lot more powerful features that just can’t be achieved in CSS alone—here we actually need JS.</p><h3 id='with-block-element-modifier-bem-is-there-any-point-where-you-feel-it-lacks'>With Block-Element-Modifier (BEM), is there any point where you feel it lacks?</h3><p>Talking about BEM as a naming convention, I honestly don’t think there’s anywhere at all in which it is lacking. This is why I love BEM so much—it covers every eventuality!</p><p>As a whole methodology, it’s not perfect (lots of repetition and redundancy, and everything needs a class on it), but it’s a great start, loaded with fantastic principles.</p><h3 id='what-about-problems-like-page-weight-bloat-have-you-ever-felt-like-its-a-problem'>What about problems like page weight bloat? Have you ever felt like it&#39;s a problem?</h3><p>There is no such problem; it’s something of a <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring'>red herring argument</a> used by people who still aren’t comfortable using classes in their markup. Other things like heavy images or bloated JS libraries will be doing a lot more to harm page weight than simple class attributes are (especially after Gzip has worked its magic). Anyone who genuinely is worried about page bloat from classes could always obfuscate their classes down from longer, human readable ones (e.g.class=&quot;nav-primary__special-offer&quot;) to much shorter ones (e.g. class=&quot;gx_aw1&quot;).</p><h3 id='how-do-you-differentiate-between-an-object-and-component-in-bem'>How do you differentiate between an object and component in BEM?</h3><p>I get asked this quite a lot, and it is actually quite hard to explain.As a general rule: if a user can identify it, it’s probably a component; if it’s private to developers (e.g. your grid system) it’s probably an object. I think the best way to differentiate is like this:</p><p>An object:</p><ul><li><p>is purely structural: it only provides structure and scaffolding (e.g. a grid system)</p></li><li><p>has no cosmetics: they can’t have font-sizes, colours, etc. applied to them</p></li><li><p>is ‘invisible’: objects don’t actually look like anything identifiable</p></li></ul><p>A component:</p><ul><li><p>actually looks like a thing: users can usually name components (e.g. a button, a carousel).</p></li><li><p>usually encapsulates a piece of functionality (e.g. a date picker).</p></li><li><p>has (structure and) cosmetics: components introduce colours, font styles, etc.</p></li></ul><h3 id='to-extend-on-the-last-question-how-should-one-organize-their-file-structure-when-starting-a-new-project-with-the-assumption-you-are-using-tools-like-sassstylusless'>To extend on the last question, how should one organize their file-structure when starting a new project?

      "contents": "<p>Faced with the closure of his previous startup, <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/wahtye'>Nico Ulbricht</a> began searching for new job opportunities in Berlin and came across <a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/'>Honeypot</a>. Following a call and a code review,  Nico became visible to companies on Honeypot:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The day after my profile was set live on the platform three companies had already contacted me, then two more followed, and another two, and so on. I didn’t expect that many companies would be applying to me - especially since I don’t have the typical background you would expect from a developer. It was pretty cool to receive that much recognition through all those companies applying to me.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Before long, Nico went with an offer from FreightHub. The entire process took 17 days. Throughout the whole process Nico was in very close contact with Fabio, his Talent Rep, who checked in making sure Nico was doing alright with his interviews.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Honeypot is such a young company, so I was surprised that there was that many big and small companies were already using the platform. Normally startup jobs are very difficult to find, and when you apply through other sites, the competition is rough. My entire experience with Honeypot has been very cool. There were just so many companies applying to me, and I wasn’t expecting it at all!”</em></p></blockquote><h2 id='is-a-degree-in-computer-science-necessary-to-become-a-professional-programmer'>Is a degree in Computer Science necessary to become a professional programmer?</h2><p>Originating from Hamburg, Nico moved to Berlin five years ago to study 3D design. Nico’s untraditional background in 3D art and printing brings up the common question: “Do I need a Computer Science degree to become a software developer?”</p><blockquote><p><em>“I feel like there is a 50/50 split with developers: the people that studied programming,  and the people that thought it was just fun to do - and then suddenly it became their job. The last one is me.”</em>  </p></blockquote><p>Far from being a disqualifying factor, Nico attributes his success (he was previously a CTO at a 3D printer firm) exactly to his varied background in technology:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I think it’s an advantage because I’ve used such a broad range of technologies, I’m not limited to one language, so whenever someone throws a problem at me I can approach it from a completely different angle. I think it really helps having different areas of expertise - it gives you a different point of view point.”</em></p></blockquote><h2 id='-so-why-freighthub'>… so why FreightHub?</h2><blockquote><p><em>“I really like startup culture due to the great atmosphere of smaller, younger teams getting together to achieve their goals.”  Nico explains.  “I enjoy it a lot - it just doesn’t feel like work!”</em></p></blockquote><p>Having interviewed with his share of startups through Honeypot, Nico eventually settled upon the offer from FreightHub. When asked what made FreightHub so special, Nico’s reasons were many and detailed, ranging from a speedy hiring process of a mere 1.5 weeks to company size and culture. As FreightHub is a very young company, and only had their official launch two months prior to Nico’s hiring, the employee count was just 10 people around the time Nico was interviewing.</p><p>However, the deciding factor leading to Nico signing a contract with FreightHub is down to the passion, excitement and encouraging leadership style of the CTO and Co-Founder, Erik Muttersbach:</p><blockquote><p><em>“When I had my interview with Erik we had these technical exercises, where even though I made a couple of mistakes here and there, we just had such a pleasant talk, and he was just so enthusiastic. You could really see his eyes light up, when talking about the product FreightHub is building, and that’s kind of the stuff that pulls you into a company”</em></p></blockquote><p>Despite already having had a taste of the life as CTO, Nico is happy with his new role:  </p><blockquote><p><em>“After all the stress I went through in my position at Twinkind, it’s great to be able to just sit down and write code having a little less responsibility. Perhaps in a couple of years I’ll pursue another role as a CTO again, but right now I’m perfectly content with where I am.”</em></p></blockquote><h2 id='so-what-did-nico-think-of-the-honeypot-experience-overall'>So what did Nico think of the Honeypot experience overall?</h2><blockquote><p><em>“It genuinely felt like Fabio, my Talent Rep, cared about me, which was really cool and very heartwarming! Before Honeypot I’ve had some pretty bad experiences with headhunters who would just throw a bunch of companies at me and I never really felt like I was supported.”</em></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=e&amp;utm_content=160906&amp;utm_campaign=dev-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>Have you ever wondered how software is built? Here is an attempt to explain software development by using an analogy with theatre. Let’s imagine we have a theatre production to stage and a software product to launch. The theatre art has some surprising similarities with software development.</p><h2 id='theatre-production-vs-software-product'>Theatre Production vs Software Product</h2><p>Both a theatre production and a software product are created for the sole purpose to satisfy a need of the target audience, for example, with theatre it is the need for entertainment. There are two key similarities:</p><ol><li><p>Both in a theatre production and in a software product, some things happen <strong>“on stage”</strong>, while others happen <strong>“behind the curtain” (backstage)</strong>.</p></li><li><p>In both cases, before the <strong>“premiere”</strong>, there is always a <strong>“rehearsal”</strong>.</p></li></ol><h2 id='producer-vs-founder'>Producer vs Founder</h2><p>In theatre it all starts with a <strong>producer</strong>. The producer is the one who makes all the necessary arrangements for the production to be put on. This person is responsible to ensure funding, to recruit the director and production staff, to set the budget, etc. The best producers are the ones who have the genius to recognise a potentially great piece of theatre.</p><p>In tech startups that build software products, a <strong>founder</strong> has pretty much the same role - to recognise a potentially great idea, to ensure funding and recruit a team to build the product, and, finally, to deliver the product to the users and make them happy.</p><h2 id='director-vs-product-manager'>Director vs Product Manager</h2><p>The director is a key figure in every theatre production and is the first person a producer needs - in amateur productions the producer can often be the director. It’s the <strong>director’s</strong> responsibility to develop the concept of the production, brief and coordinate the production staff, plot the actor&#39;s moves, rehearse the actors. Finally, bring an awesome production to the audience.</p><p>Similarly, in software development, the <strong>product manager</strong> is in charge of the product. In a Scrum team, the product manager is called Product Owner. This role requires collaboration with the target users, knowledge about the competitors and current industry trends. The Product Owner collects business requirements and feedback from all stakeholders (founders, users, partners, the team, etc), then writes customer-centric items (typically user stories), prioritizes them, adds them to the product backlog and discusses them with the tech team. The user stories explain what features need to be built by the tech team.</p><h2 id='on-stage-vs-frontend'>On Stage vs Frontend</h2><p>If we think of a theatre performance, what comes first to our mind is a picture of actors on stage, with dialogues, choreography, costumes, makeup, lights, music, sound effects, etc - in other words, we think of that part of the production that is visible to us, the audience. </p><p>Similarly, with a software product, what we usually think of is the user interface, the part of the product that we can see, click, interact with. This visible part of a software product is called <strong>frontend or client-side or user-facing-site</strong> and it consists of user interface elements such as buttons, fill-in forms, drop-down lists, pop-up windows, pieces of content (text, image, audio, video) etc.  </p><p>What are the roles on the frontend of software development?</p><h2 id='set-costume-makeup-designer-vs-uxui-designer'>Set/ Costume/ Makeup Designer vs UX/UI Designer</h2><p>In theater, the responsibility to immerse the audience in the play belongs to the <strong>creative staff members</strong> such as set designer, costume designer, makeup designer, hair stylist, etc.</p><p>In software development the <strong>UX/UI Designer</strong> is the one responsible to create a user experience and workflow that is intuitive to the user. The goal is to create the most natural flow, so that users can notice the important parts of the product (ex, the “Buy Now” button) and be encouraged to take important actions like add a item to the cart and proceed with payment, without being distracted. This includes designing different interface elements: buttons, drop-down lists, navigation components like search fields and tags, informational items like user response messages and progress bars.</p><p>UX/UI Tools: Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, Fireworks, InVision</p><h2 id='set-decorator-choreographer-vs-frontend-developer'>Set Decorator/ Choreographer vs Frontend Developer</h2><p>In theatre, <strong>professionals like</strong> set decorators, choreographers, makeup artists, carpenters, electricians, among others, are the staff members that implement what the set, the costume, the makeup designers have created. In smaller productions, these could actually be the same people - for example, the makeup designer could also be the makeup artist or the costume designer could also be the one who creates the costumes and maintains them.</p><p>Similarly, in the early days of a startup, basic design can be done by the frontend developer. Keep in mind, the opposite is rarely valid - usually designers cannot do frontend coding. In software development, <strong>frontend developers</strong> are responsible for creating the functional implementation of the product&#39;s interface. Usually, a UX/UI Designer provides either a static or an interactive mockup (InVision is a cool tool to help with that) to the frontend developer who then translates it into a working, interactive experience.</p><p>Frontend Languages: CSS, HTML, JavaScript</p><p>JavaScript Frontend Frameworks: React, Angular, Ember, jQuery, Backbone, Meteor, Knockout, Vanilla, D3.js</p><h2 id='backstage-vs-backend'>Backstage vs Backend</h2><p>To make the play run on stage, however, you need lots of stuff and staff working backstage: think of building and changing sceneries, costumes, hairstyles, makeup, or the operation of all the equipment behind the scene such as lanterns (lights), sound effect machines, ladders, and the green room (backstage lounge or waiting room for the actors, which is almost never painted in green!). </p><p>In most of the cases, the <strong>backend or the server-side</strong> of a software product consists of, at least, a server, an application, and a database. When users interact with the frontend of the product, they trigger actions on the server side (behind the scenes). For example, when a user clicks on “Friends” on a Facebook profile, the backend triggers a set of actions that eventually return in the browser the respective friend list. In fact, that click triggers so many actions on the backend that it would take pages to list them all, but for the sake of simplicity, imagine the backend request checks the database and returns the friend list.</p><p>What are the roles on the backend of software development?</p><h2 id='theatrical-technician-vs-backend-developer'>Theatrical Technician vs Backend Developer</h2><p><strong>Theatrical technician</strong> is a broad name for all &quot;unseen&quot; theatrical personnel who practice stagecraft and are responsible for the logistic and production-related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors. For example, the electrics crew is responsible for the maintenance of the lighting, and the operation of the lighting plot, and the stagehand crew’s work includes setting up the scenery, lights, sound, props, rigging, and special effects for the production.</p><p>A similar role in software development has the <strong>backend developer</strong> who creates and maintains the entire backend of a software product, which consists of the core application logic, databases, data and application integration, APIs and other backend processes. Moreover, a backend developer also performs testing and debugging of any backend application or system.</p><p>Backend Languages: Ruby, Python, Java, Rust, Scala, Golang, PHP, Perl, Erlang, Elixir</p><p>Web Server Technologies: Apache, Nginx, lighttpd</p><p>Database: MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB</p><p><img src='/assets/images/twin-roles.png' alt='twin-roles.png'></p><h2 id='stage-manager-vs-devops'>Stage Manager vs DevOps</h2><p>The stage manager has several key responsibilities and tasks to perform in each phase of a production, such as scheduling and running rehearsals, overseeing the entire show each time it is performed. <strong>The stage manager</strong> and the <strong>technical director</strong> together work out a smooth and efficient plan for the stage crew to follow during set changes. Furniture and prop plans for complicated sets are drawn up by the stage manager and technical designer to show exactly where the furniture and props are to be positioned on stage at the beginning of each scene and sometimes in the wings.</p><p>Similarly to theatre, in software development <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/what-is-devops/'><strong>DevOps</strong></a> works closely with <strong>System Admin</strong> and the DevOps role is to remove the incompatibility between development and product environments by creating code that automates and speeds up the tasks of the SysAdmin. Thanks to the DevOps, fixes, restructurings and deployments are automated and changes can be applied to all servers automatically rather than one-by-one manually.</p><p>Let’s take this sentence: “The stage manager and the technical director together work out a smooth and efficient plan for the stage crew to follow during set changes.” In software development, DevOps facilitates the deployment of code, so that the tech team and the SysAdmin do not exchange “tickets” back and forth before they manage to make the code ready to deploy in production.</p><p>DevOps Tools: Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Docker, Vagrant, Salt, Travis.CI, Circle.CI, Jenkins, Capistrano</p><h2 id='technical-director-vs-system-admin'>Technical Director vs System Admin</h2><p>The <strong>Technical Director (TD)</strong> operates, maintains and safeguards the technical assets of the theatre, including supervising the use of lighting, sound, communications equipment, and the use and maintenance of stage facilities. The TD supervises and assists with set and stage construction and management, monitors the condition of the equipment, including lighting, sound, and rigging, and performs preventive maintenance on equipment. He also attends technical week rehearsals, in order to supervise and assist in the technical aspects of mounting the show.</p><p>Similarly, the <strong>System Admin’s</strong> job is to maintain the system up and running. SysAdmins are usually charged with installing, supporting, and maintaining servers or other computer systems, and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems. Other duties may include scripting, project management for systems-related projects, etc. Nowadays, with cloud computing, SysAdmins are responsible for automation, cloud infrastructure, networks services such as content delivery networks and DNS servers, source control, security.</p><p>System Admin Tools: puppet, chef, AWS, Openstack, Akamai, CloudFront</p><h2 id='rehearsal--premiere-vs-staging--production'>Rehearsal &amp; Premiere vs Staging &amp; Production</h2><p>Every theatre production has rehearsals before going live in front of the audience. Before the <strong>premiere</strong>, there are two important <strong>rehearsals</strong>: the dress rehearsal, which is the final rehearsal before the show opens with full costumes, makeup, lights, sound, props, etc, and the technical rehearsal, which is a rehearsal for perfecting lights, scenery, sound, and other technical elements.</p><p>In software development, things work similarly. Before releasing a product update to the users, there is a testing phase in a safe environment away from real users, called staging environment. Here, just like at a dress rehearsal or at the technical rehearsal, the QA Engineer tests, makes sure that acceptance criteria are covered and the product is ready to be released. Finally, the environment where the software is publicly accessible by users is called the production environment. </p><h2 id='rehearsal-director-vs-qa-engineer'>Rehearsal Director vs QA Engineer</h2><p>Rehearsals are one of the most important aspects of running a professional theatre production and take up a great deal of the preparation. Professional productions have <strong>Rehearsal Director</strong>, in amateur ones, rehearsals can be run by the director.</p><p>In developing software products, quality assurance (QA) is a systematic process of checking to see whether a product or service being developed is meeting specified requirements. Usually, bigger teams have a dedicated <strong>QA Engineer</strong>, but when the team is still small, QA can be performed by the Product Owner and/or members of the tech team.</p><h2 id='mobile-developer'>Mobile Developer</h2><p>Mobile is just another platform to release a product on. To launch a mobile app for a web product is like making a movie out of a theatre production. Same story, different platform to present it on, and an opportunity to widen your reach. A <strong>Mobile Developer</strong> is simply building the mobile version of a web (or desktop) application. Keep in mind that there is a difference between responsive websites optimised for mobile devices and native mobile apps that are created for mobile platforms (iOS , Android, Windows Phone).</p><p>Mobile Languages: Objective-C, Swift (iOS), Java (Android)</p><p>If you have feedback or ideas how to improve this post, let me know: <a target='_blank' href='mailto:jt@honeypot.io'>jt@honeypot.io</a></p><hr><h2 id='curious-facts-about-theatre'>Curious facts about theatre:</h2><ul><li><em>“Mr Sands” in theatrical code is used to warn theatre employees of a fire without frightening the audience. &quot;Mr Sands is in the foyer&quot; means that fire has broken out in the foyer.</em> </li></ul><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.honeypot.io/pages/for_employers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=g&amp;utm_content=160907&amp;utm_campaign=hr-no'>Join Honeypot</a> today and connect with top, pre-screened developers.

JavaScript is this unconventional language that computer scientists tend to look down on and disparage.” </p><p>While some find JavaScript’s syntax and semantics endlessly frustrating, Angus considers its malleability its core strength, “Part of what the book tries to say is that JavaScript is quirky and magical and ridiculously expressive–it has more in common with spoken languages than boring conventional software languages, and that&#39;s something to be proud of.”  </p><p>Each chapter is dedicated to a specific author, poet or playwright, everyone from Hemingway, Salinger and Shakespeare to Kafka, Kerouac and Tupac. The chapters are spliced with poetic interludes, which use famous literary excerpts to explain features of the language, such as variables, lost callbacks, and refactors. </p><p>The book should appeal to lovers of all languages - computer and non-computer alike.

      "contents": "<p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/termie'>Andy Smith</a> is CTO at Wercker, an Amsterdam-based tech company providing a continuous delivery system using containers. Andy joined Wercker two and half years ago and oversaw the transition of the platform from LXC to Docker. When hiring developers, Andy pays special tribute to open source contributions, valuing a broadportfolio of open source projects.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/wercker-box.png' alt='wercker-box.png'></p><h2 id='how-was-the-transition-from-lxc-to-docker'>How was the transition from LXC to Docker?</h2><p>In the early days Wercker was using LXC, but as Docker came to the forefront - which was around the time I joined the company - we switched everything over. This was my original task when joining Wercker -- figuring out how we could switch to Docker. We were early adopters, and Docker has grown quite a lot since then. </p><p>Switching to Docker was harder than expected. Back then, you’d see the documentation and think “Oh, cool! We can use Docker for all these projects!” However, in reality, it was broken in certain ways, so when we started implementing Docker, we didn’t realise how much trouble we were going to be in. The underlying implementation didn’t take very long, but working around all the issues took a lot longer. Nowadays, infrastructure is still a massive priority to keep it all going. </p><h2 id='what-tech-stack-are-you-currently-using'>What tech stack are you currently using?</h2><p>On a base level, we’re running AWS. Well, we’re running <a target='_blank' href='https://coreos.com/'>CoreOS</a> on AWS, and we’re running <a target='_blank' href='http://kubernetes.io'>Kubernetes</a> on top of that, as well as raw Docker. On the frontend, we’re using Node, and on the very frontend, we’re using React. We tend to use a lot of features from all those different products. We also have our own scheduling software written, but that is pretty much it! From the bottom to top: AWS, CoreOS, Kubernetes, Docker, Node and React. Oh! And all of our backend code is written in Go. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/wercker-office-3.jpg' alt='wercker-office-3.jpg'></p><h2 id='is-the-tech-stack-going-to-change-in-the-near-future'>Is the tech stack going to change in the near future?</h2><p>Yeah, we’re moving as fast as we can to become Cloud Agnostic. We want to focus on Kubernetes because they have a large install base and there is an active moving community. Ideally, we want to ask people to run Kubernetes only. On the Node versus Go side, nearly all new API’s are written in Go, so by using Kubernetes, it should be pretty easy for us to set up new services. </p><p>Also, we&#39;re current fully on AWS, and it just doesn&#39;t make sense to lock ourselves in. There are a lot of people who want to use Wercker, but not all of them are on AWS. If we could provide them with a product that only requires Kubernetes, we would be closer to meeting their needs with minimal changes on our end. It&#39;s a lot less code for use to write in the future. However, we&#39;re not actively moving on from AWS right now, just considering our options for making our product more useful to more people.</p><h2 id='what-value-do-open-source-contributions-bring-wercker'>What value do open source contributions bring Wercker?</h2><p>We have something called “the Step Marketplace”, which is where the community helps create pre-built tool sets. If you’re a Scala developer using SBT (or any other Scala toolkit), and there happens to be other Scala developers using Wercker who have already provided a solution for that, you will be able to use the things others have already build. You build a pipeline that provides a description of every single task. There are several steps making up each task for building your service. It’s very easy! Using Go as an example, most things happen the same way, and there’s a lot of pre-built steps available to make your life easier. </p><h2 id='have-you-ever-had-any-problems-with-the-quality-of-the-contributions'>Have you ever had any problems with the quality of the contributions?</h2><p>We’ve definitely experienced that several things stopped being maintained. However, we have some new stuff in the works, which aims to reinvigorate the community. This should make it easier for publishers to maintain stuff as well as provide better control and visibility of the steps, encouraging people to maintain steps. The fun part of open source is that it’s easy to use, and we want to show people that their work is being used and appreciated. </p><h2 id='how-big-is-your-team'>How big is your team?</h2><p>Wercker has around 15 employees right now. We’ve hired a lot of people recently, so we will probably be 20 by the end of the month. Not everyone is a developer though. We have four people working on the commercial side of the organisation, we have two HR people, and the remaining bunch are mostly developers. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/wercker-office-1.jpg' alt='wercker-office-1.jpg'></p><h2 id='what-is-the-interview-process-like-at-wercker'>What is the interview process like at Wercker?</h2><p>In terms of the hiring process itself, we tend to ask candidates to come to the office where we have a small programming task for them to do. It usually takes half a day, but it’s a really good way for us to gauge how they interact with people.</p><h2 id='do-open-source-contributions-play-a-role-in-your-hiring-process'>Do open source contributions play a role in your hiring process?</h2><p>I personally prefer hiring people that work with open source. It’s the easiest way of seeing how someone works, who they work with and what kind of stuff they are able to do. My preference will always be the person who has a large portfolio of open source projects, that let’s them show me a pull request they’ve submitted, fixing the issues in the comments. </p><p>What I’ve been adding recently to my list of requests is to show me some of your good bug reports and the issues that you’ve posted, which proves that you are able to communicate with other people. I believe those are the two main qualities I look for in a developer: A) that you’ve worked on various projects and B) that you can communicate and respond well to criticism from pull requests. Everything else can be learned very quickly! </p><h2 id='how-would-you-describe-the-office-culture-at-wercker'>How would you describe the office culture at Wercker?</h2><p>Everyone works from an office. People can work from home if they need to, but we have a very nice office and it’s just easier to work together this way. Most people in the SF office live in the same neighbourhood, so the commute is easy. There’s actually not a lot of work being done from home. I think people are quite sociable, and they will get more work done if there’s other people around. </p><p>The SF team mainly works on the backend, so we don&#39;t have to have meetings with the frontend team in Amsterdam as often, but people are working on the backend in Amsterdam, too. I guess, to some degree the teams are a little bit separated. There’s definitely communication issues due to to timezones when everyone is trying to work on the same thing at the same time, and it’s difficult ensuring perfect alignment of everybody’s KPIs. </p><p>However, we do use a bunch of tools to make work and communication easier, making it easier when somebody is working remote. Obviously we use a chat, Slack, which is probably the most popular one nowadays. We also use GitHub, and we have different channels for hosting information. We have meetings - even on a subteam level. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/wercker-office-2.jpg' alt='wercker-office-2.jpg'></p><h2 id='who-typically-uses-wercker'>Who typically uses Wercker?</h2><p>Our users are sort of a mix of startup and corporate. Startups is a given, but there is a vision amongst some larger companies to ditch old build tools and tech and instead go for something more modern. These would typically be our ideal customers. We want to grow with a startup or within a larger company. </p><p>Another place we&#39;ve seen some surprising growth has been in design consultancies. In simple terms developers would be able to go and build something for a company, without having to use that company’s servers. Instead they would set up their own stuff and use our software services on a day-to-day, setting up the pipelines in Wercker for easy maintenance of the product they are building. </p><h2 id='what-is-your-vision-for-the-development-of-the-product-over-the-next-couple-of-years'>What is your vision for the development of the product over the next couple of years?</h2><p>We&#39;re working on really nailing down the performance and reliability of the system as we improve the ability for the community to share their tools with each other and take on the needs of bigger enterprises.</p><hr>",

Jobs can vary from linguistics in natural language processing, predictive modeling in data mining to software engineers in self-driving cars. However, there has to be some underlying distinction between the jobs, at least as far as machine learning (ML) is concerned.</p><!-- Main image --><h3 id='what-is-machine-learning'>What is Machine Learning?</h3><p>In simple terms, <em>it is a process of training a system to perform a task without describing how it should perform the task</em>. A more technical definition would be: *&quot;... a machine learns with respect to a particulartask T, performance metric P, and type of experience E, if the system reliably improves its performanceP at task T, following experience E.&quot;* [^1]</p><p>This involves taking a series of inputs, feeding them into a system, and allowing a system to learn what is a desired output. Through tweaking of parameters, the system eventually discovers how to come up with a relevant output. Lets say you want to detect whether an x-ray image has a defective tissue (task T). You would prepare a series of images that are labeled as defective and non-defective and allow the system (in this case, an algorithm) to figure out what a defective looks like in an x-ray image (experience E). Later on, you would pass a new series of images without labels, to measure how well the system has learned (performance P).</p><h3 id='what-are-the-nature-of-jobs-involved-in-this-process'>What are the nature of jobs involved in this process?</h3><p>Lets stick with the previous example of detecting defective tissues. To understand the type of jobs involved in the process, it would help to break down the entire process. For a start, there is a database hosting the list of x-ray images. This requires a smooth process to extract these images and attach them to their respective labels. For the algorithm to work as intended, the data - images in this case - needs some cleaning up. This ensures the final results are not tainted by mismatched data.</p><p>Then comes the process of analyzing results from each experience iteration. This will determine what tweaks are needed to improve on the performance of our algorithm. This is mostly an exploratory process without clear outline on how to improve on the performance. It can involve changing the chosen algorithm, normalization of the data (i.e: making sure most of the data is relative and outliers are removed) and even reevaluating labeling the original x-ray images.</p><p>It quickly becomes clear that there are two main types of machine learning jobs:</p><h3 id='data-engineer'>Data Engineer:</h3><p>In our x-ray images example, data engineers are concerned with the first task. They would prepare the entire infrastructure for our experiment. It involves designing, building and managing our data pipeline. It can also involve setting up reporting tools for a smoother analysis process. Most of the analysis will be done on top of this architecture. Some common tools for data engineers include: Hadoop, Pig, Hive, MapReduce, Redshift</p><p>A good point to consider is the amount of data involved in most machine learning tasks. While most engineering tasks involve several gigabytes of data, it is not uncommon for a machine learning project to involve several terabytes of data. The famous <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize'>Netflix Prize</a>, had over 100 Million Netflix ratings involving 480,000+ users. In the x-ray example, the infrastructure must be able to handle processing thousands of images and the data engineer is tasked with benchmarking the system.</p><p>Data engineers are usually regular software engineers with a background in machine learning. While they do not necessarily need to possess any knowledge on machine learning, it does help especially when some data insight is necessary. </p><h3 id='data-scientist'>Data Scientist:</h3><p>While data engineers are concerned with the architecture of the project, data scientists are tasked with the analysis part. They start with data cleaning and normalization, then onto exploration which usually involves some data visualizations, data modeling and finally testing. This cycle is usually done several times until no improvements are necessary. On occasion, data scientists are required to have some background knowledge within the field involved. In our defective tissue case, they could possess more information on the disease in question and what to look for. Usually, this ends up being handy when choosing features and picking up on biases within the models. Not only can this improve the understanding of the problem but can also significantly cut down on the time required to run the experiment.</p><p>Data scientists usually possess a masters or PhD in machine learning, although it is <a target='_blank' href='https://mathbabe.org/2013/04/05/guest-post-how-i-got-a-data-science-job/'>not requirement</a>. This is a result of insight needed to pick up on patterns needed to solve specific problems. As previously stated, there is no one solution to all data projects, and decent results can be achieved with multiple algorithms - with some approaches <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning'>using a combination of multiple algorithms</a>. This is unsurprising; devising an algorithm for defective tissue detection requires a different approach to designing a speech detection bot. </p><p>Some common tools for data scientists are Python, Caffe, R, Scala and various language specific frameworks for implemented algorithms.</p><h3 id='the-future-of-data-science'>The Future of Data Science</h3><p>Data science is still a young and growing industry. With the amount of data generated, it is not unsurprising to see the demand of machine learning jobs increase. There are more novel jobs mushrooming, for instance data visualization positions are now a common occurrence in big data environments.

But all of this makes living here very expensive, which can make things more complicated for organizations that are just starting. </p><p><strong>Boris:</strong> Expert knowledge is a great support for startups and also many founders already have experiences before they start a company. Recreational value and work- life balance are also additional bonus points for Munich. In addition, we have  lots of investors: large corporations and leading digital companies are here. In recent years, Munich has developed into a relevant startup ecosystem. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/scout24-image1.jpeg' alt='Scout24'></p><h2 id='do-you-have-any-good-examples-of-startups-working-with-corporates-in-munich'>Do you have any good examples of startups working with corporates in Munich?</h2><p><strong>Boris:</strong> At Scout24 we work and exchange a lot with startups, in various ways. Acquisitions are one of them: Easyautosale is a good example of integrating a new product into our core business to expand our portfolio. We often run tests with startups which could bring value to our customers. We see the benefit in startup drive and speed and are open to bringing our strength to the table for potential partnerships.

If you take Bavaria, the state to which Munich is the capital, as a whole, that number jumps to 16%. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-industries.png' alt='Munich-tech-industries'></p><p>While Berlin is home to the most startups in Germany, Munich’s strength is its mix of old and new industry. The reasons for Munich’s economic strength are both cultural and historical: following WW2, many firms moved production from East to West Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany again underwent a sustained period of deindustrialization; large rundown East German industries were sold off to West German companies by the German Treuhand agency, created in 1990 to privatize state-owned East German assets. </p><p>While Bavaria flourished, Berlin floundered. And despite over €2 trillion of financial transfers from the former West to the former East, huge disparities still exist between the regions, in measures such as labor productivity, GDP, and income. Maps comparing the regions <a target='_blank' href='http://www.dw.com/en/mapping-differences-in-two-german-economies/a-17734799'>confirm this fact</a>.</p><p>For software developers interested in working in Munich, Bavaria’s dominant economic position has a number of implications. First, wages are higher here than in Berlin, but so is the cost of living. Second, there is a broader choice in types of companies and industries to work for, but fewer startups. To give a rough analogy, Munich is to Berlin what New York is to Silicon Valley. </p><p>Despite fewer startups, Bavarian automotive, finance, and media giants based in Munich are eager to cement Germany’s reputation not just as a traditional engineering powerhouse, but also as a world leader in software engineering, which makes Munich a rather exciting place  for software developers to be. </p><h2 id='mobility-in-munich'>Mobility in Munich</h2><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-Mobility.png' alt='Mobility-tech-Munich'></p><p>Every <a target='_blank' href='https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/wirtschaft_en/industries/automotive.html'>fourth German car</a>  is made in Bavaria. Munich is home to BMW and various other suppliers. Audi is based 50 minutes away in nearby Ingolstadt.  Close to 200,000 people in Munich are employed in the automotive industry, which generated <a target='_blank' href='https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/wirtschaft_en/industries/automotive.html'>€110 billion in revenue in 2014</a>.  The shift to autonomous driving is a big topic in the city, and one which dominates strategy of major carmakers. </p><p>At a December meeting of BMW, Munich’s most famous carmaker, the company’s CEO Harald Krüger, admitted that Apple, Google, Uber and Lyft were <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ft.com/content/9c04b2b6-ba3a-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080'>“very dangerous players”</a> in the car market.  Krüger was talking days after BMW had posted its best-ever earnings, which largely came from record sales in its BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands. Despite its bumper profits,  BMWs shares were down by a fifth, reflecting concerns of shareholders about the encroaching influence of tech companies. </p><p>In the same meeting, Krüger added that Germany’s background in engineering and automation made it the ideal location to respond to trends, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ft.com/content/9c04b2b6-ba3a-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080'>“We in Germany have the best conditions for a new era of mobility,”</a> he said, adding that the car industry was not being transformed, but was simply “on the move”.</p><p>BMW is currently extending its reach into tech and startups. <a target='_blank' href='https://de.drive-now.com/#'>DriveNow</a>, the pay-by-the-minute car-sharing service launched in 2011 is owned by BMW, and now operates in 11 European cities. The US version, ReachNow, which launched in three pilot cities in 2016 and has 32,000 members. The company also has a VC arm, iVentures, which operates a <a target='_blank' href='http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/corporation/bmwi_ventures/'>$530 million fund</a>, investing in shared mobility, virtual reality, in-vehicle digitalization, and cloud technologies. </p><p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.bmwstartupgarage.com/'>BMW Startup Garage</a> is BMW’s Venture Client and is also based in Munich. It is focused on automotive technology and urban mobility. For startups in the program, BMW buys a first unit of the startup’s technology, provides office space and supports in manufacturing of a prototype, as well as access to skills through BMW’s innovation centres. </p><p>Daimler is also investing in startups in Munich. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.daimler.com/products/services/mobility-services/'>Daimler Mobility</a> invested in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.flixbus.com/'>FlixBus</a>, a long distance bus company with an online booking platform, which since the end of the railroad monopoly and the privatization of the intercity bus market in Germany, has been offering bus tickets at very low prices.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sixt.de/'>Sixt</a>, a car rental company with about 4,000 locations in over 105 countries, is also encouraging entrepreneurship within the company. According to Boyan Dimitrov, Director of Platform Engineering at Sixt, one of the biggest technical challenges has been the shift to a new mindset about building cloud-native software: “Running applications in a cloud environment is something new for us, because we are used to operating our own data centers and therefore we are used to managing our applications in a certain way. Now when we are building applications on the cloud we have to think more about how they behave in an environment which we do not fully control. Its been a steep learning curve to figure out how to build automated and resilient software that relies on self-healing.”</p><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-security.png' alt='IoT-tech-Munich'></p><h2 id='that-thing-that-thing-that-internet-of-things'>That thing, that thing, that Internet of Things</h2><p>Munich’s combination of high-tech industries, knowledge-intensive services and traditional production make the city a fertile breeding ground for emerging Internet of Things companies. While the phrase IoT <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.bolt.io/the-internet-of-dumb-things-49d102018e16#.qidse9250'>irks many developers</a>  for its overly generalized and somewhat inexplicable applications, the term is useful as a catch-all phrase to describe the connection of everyday objects to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-software.png' alt='internet-of-things-Munich'></p><p>In December 2015, IBM opened its <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/'>Watson IoT Global Headquarters</a> in Munich where a team of 1000 developers, consultants, researchers and designers are working on cognitive computing. This is IBM’s largest investment in Europe in more than two decades. “The Internet of Things will soon be the largest single source of data on the planet, yet almost 90 percent of that data is never acted upon,” said Harriet Green, general manager, Watson IoT and Education. “With its unique abilities to sense, reason and learn, Watson opens the door for enterprises, governments and individuals to finally harness this real-time data, compare it with historical data sets and deep reservoirs of accumulated knowledge, and then find unexpected correlations that generate new insights to benefit business and society alike.”</p><p>According to IBM, there are more than 9 billion connected devices operating in the world today, generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily. Making sense of data embedded in intelligent devices is creating a significant market opportunity that is expected to reach $1.7 trillion by 2020. A number of startups in Munich are attempting to capture this market. </p><p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.proglove.de'>ProGlove</a> developed the first smart glove used for industrial purposes. Jonas Girardet, CTO and one of the company’s founders, described the growing interest of corporates in Munich’s startups, “I think the last years there has been a shift in thinking on high management levels about how to speed up the innovation process. Now large companies really want to work with startups, especially here in Munich where there is a technology hub provided by the network of startups, universities and corporates” He continued that innovation is key to maintaining Germany’s position as a driver for manufacturing processes.  ProGlove received support from corporate clients in developing prototypes and use cases for their product.</p><p>Similarly <a target='_blank' href='https://www.konux.com/'>Konux</a> are developing smart sensor systems helping industrial companies to reduce maintenance costs with artificial intelligence. <a target='_blank' href='http://kinexon.com/'>Kinexon’s</a> technology is being used to improve manufacturing and logistics processes and products in navigation of driverless transport systems, asset tracking, process mapping and worker safety management. </p><p>Another IoT company to emerge from Munich is <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bragi.com/thedash/'>Bragi</a>. The company launched in 2014, following  a successful $3.3 million Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.  A year later, it launched Dash, the first completely wireless smart headphones, which can be used to listen to music, track your heart rate and oxygen saturation,, among other features.  Dash is a powerful microcomputer with more than 150 micro components, 27 sensors and a 32-bit processor. Bragi switched from Bluetooth to a technology called Near-Field Magnetic Induction, or NFMI, which uses a low-power magnetic field to transmit data.  </p><p>For startups operating in IoT in Munich, the efficient supply chains are a huge benefit. CTO of Bragi, Toby Martin, commented, “The list of requirements to make the Dash is enormous; it was far far more complicated than we anticipated when we started. But when we were struggling with electronics, with the materials, the optics and the components, we always found that somewhere near Munich there was a company doing precisely what we needed and there were happy to help us. And certainly in the wider community of Munich companies there was a sense for community.” </p><p>The dominant programming languages these IoT companies in Munich are hiring for are C++, Node.js and Python. </p><h2 id='virtual-reality-munich'>Virtual Reality Munich</h2><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-vr.png' alt='internet-of-things-Munich'></p><p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.metaio.eu/'>Metaio</a> are the pioneers of Augmented Reality (AR) in Munich. Their purchase by Apple in 2015 catapulted Munich to the forefront of AR worldwide. While exact figures on the number of companies operating in AR and Virtual Reality (VR) in Munich are scarce, there is a vibrant community and some strong emerging players. </p><p>Like IoT, the development of AR and VR in Munich is tied to a mix of excellent universities, strong corporate support and dynamic community initiatives. </p><p>The city is home to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tum.de/'>Technische Universität München</a>, where world-class research is being conducted under the guidance of Professor Klinker. Likewise, the <a target='_blank' href='http://filmzentrum-bayern.de/home/'>Bayerisches Filmzentrum</a> offer coaching and support for content creators on the 360°/VR track of the First Movie Program, as well as workshops, labs, masterclasses and events. Automotive companies, such as BMW, and media companies, like Pro7 and Sky are working on AR and VR applications. Last year, Audi launched its <a target='_blank' href='https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/10/audi-vr-dealership-car-configurator/'>VR experience</a> in selected dealerships, to give customers an idea for the look and feel of their potential new purchase. </p><p>According to Dirk Schart, co-organizer of the VR and Mixed Reality Meetups, companies like Google are also supporting the local scene by sponsoring meetups.  This confluence of community, corporate support and technical skills have given rise to a number of AR/VR companies in Munich. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.re-flekt.com/'>RE’FLEKT</a>, for example, was founded in 2012, and creates AR and VR technologies, such as face tracking, which they are developing for the augmented windows of Elon Musk’s <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A7GsAPR3J0'>Hyperloop</a>.

We used data from the careers websites of the companies featured, from GitHub, from Angel.co and from company profiles on Honeypot. </p><p>In order to calculate the most popular programming languages in Munich, we looked at the frequency of mentions of a particular programming language across all companies. Thus, if a company mentions Python and Ruby within its tech stack, then each is counted once. The frequency of mentions of each individual language was then calculated as a percentage of total companies with their tech stack publically available. </p><p>Here is what we found. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/munich-backend-languages.png' alt='backend-languages-munich'></p><p>The three most popular backend languages in Munich are Java, PHP and Python.

They often perform pre-defined tasks with very specific requirements.</p><p>Embedded systems can be microprocessors, the tiny electronic chips found inside a computer&#39;s central processing unit (CPU), which compute and calculate the commands. They can also be microcontroller-based, which is usually a SoC (System on a chip) containing logic units, memory slots, and I/O peripherals, etc. In either case, there is an integrated circuit (IC) at the heart of the product that is generally designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.</p><h3 id='what-are-some-examples-of-embedded-systems'>What are some examples of embedded systems?</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous question, think of an embedded system as any electronic device that assists you to solve a specific problem. Mobile phones, microwaves, coffee machines, fridges, air conditioning, traffic lights and remote controls are all examples of embedded systems. There are <a target='_blank' href='https://www.mepits.com/tutorial/299/Embedded-System/Embedded-Systems-in-Automobiles---A-Boon-to-Automobile-Industry'>many embedded systems in cars</a>, such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, and SatNav systems. </p><h3 id='what-do-embedded-engineers-do'>What do embedded engineers do?</h3><p>Embedded engineers typically have control over both hardware and software design.  Typically this requires an in-depth knowledge of embedded architectures.  </p><h3 id='what-skills-do-embedded-engineers-have'>What skills do embedded engineers have?</h3><p>Embedded engineers generally come from an Electrical Engineering, Computer Science background and have total command of embedded architecture. The most common programming language used by embedded engineers is C/C++.</p><p>Maharajan Veerabahu suggests to think of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-roles-played-embedded-engineer-maharajan-veerabahu?trk=prof-post'>embedded engineers</a> in five key roles: micro-controller firmware engineers, embedded operating system engineers, embedded networking engineers, embedded applications engineer and embedded technology experts. Each has its own particular specialities, but in general the key skills include: </p><ul><li>C or C++: hardware related C programming is the bedrock of embedded engineering. This includes knowledge of the processor and the compiler do behind the scenes</li><li>Understanding of operating systems: embedded developers usually need experience in programming in embedded Linux or similar embedded operating systems</li><li>Knowledge of assembly language: competency in at least one assembly language, such as ARM or x86</li></ul><p>Other skills include: </p><ul><li>Basic electronics: embedded engineers use oscilloscopes, logic analyzers and multimeters for debugging</li><li>Algorithms - search, sort, b-trees</li><li>Design Patterns - factory, observer, singleton etc.</li><li>Microprocessor fundamentals - interrupt processing, registers, assembly code, etc.</li><li>Microcontroller fundamentals - ADC, DAC, Timers, PWM, DMA, watchdog, etc.</li><li>Memory - NOR, NAND, SRAM, DRAM, wear levelling</li><li>Basic protocols - I2C, SPI, UART, LIN</li><li>Advanced protocols - SATA, PCIE, USB, CAN, MOST</li><li>Concurrent/ parallel programming - MPI for SMP etc.</li><li>UML - class diagram, component diagram, state diagram, sequence diagram</li><li>Perl or Python for scripting, for e.g. to modify simple text files.</li><li>Specialized techniques for embedded programming e.g. debouncing of switches, resistive ladder switches, rotary encoders, etc.</li><li>Software architecture for embedded systems, software design, software integration and / or system programming </li><li>Build environments - makefile, cmake</li><li>Basic FPGA/ ASIC design, basic DSP</li><li>Embedded developers working on commercial IoT devices usually need experience with some of the following: HMI programming, audio stacks (microphone, filters and DSP)</li><li>Other programming languages which can be complementary are Rust, Go, Python</li></ul><p>This list comes largely from a <a target='_blank' href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17210254/embedded-developer-what-skills-are-important'>StackOverflow thread</a>, on the topic. </p><h3 id='what-is-the-difference-between-an-embedded-engineer-and-a-software-engineer'>What is the difference between an embedded engineer and a software engineer?</h3><p>Like software engineers, embedded engineers code, debug, test and write the corresponding documentation. Unlike software engineers, embedded engineers work largely with hardware, and often need to develop or configure a custom operating system unique to the hardware and memory map of the device. Embedded Engineers must also consider safety.  For example, the embedded system in charge of car’s brake system can not fail. </p><p>Check out what Roger DiPaolo, an embedded engineer with 35 years of experience, said in this <a target='_blank' href='https://www.quora.com/Will-firmware-and-embedded-system-hardware-engineers-be-in-higher-demand-than-application-software-engineers'>Quora answer on the topic</a> answer:</p><p>“Consider that the typical embedded system is a highly custom device. It’s not a standard platform where there is a wealth of pre-written code (libraries) that a developer can just “drop in” and write a few lines of glue code. Most embedded firmware is custom, meaning that on a typical embedded project a high percentage of the code is new code, meaning that more development time, and more developers are required.”</p><h3 id='how-does-iot-relate-to-embedded-systems'>How does IoT relate to embedded systems?</h3><p>Most Internet of Things (IoT) products are in fact embedded devices which are connected to the internet. IoT fans imagine a world where the internet and cloud resources process huge amounts of data collected by these devices, and use it to improve the services and devices.</p><p>With the growth of IoT, micro-controller firmware engineers, who  specialize in C programming, know some assembly languages, and are adept at designing simple devices, will be in high demand.</p>",

Otherwise you&#39;ll keep shooting in the dark. Also, I like to try new technologies. That&#39;s why I am working in the ever-changing world of JavaScript.”</p><h3 id='open-source'>Open Source</h3><p>The ever-changing nature of JavaScript drew Shuhei to work on open source projects around <a target='_blank' href='https://babeljs.io/'>Babel</a>, a JavaScript compiler, which allows you to compile ES2015+ into ECMAScript 5 enabling it to run on most modern browsers.</p><p>“I used to work often on frontend tool chain, like gulp-browserify, karma-babel-preprocessor, and babel plugins for Angular 2.

Europe was my first candidate because it has a lot of places to visit, many companies to work with, culture and history to learn.”</p></blockquote><p>Within two weeks of being accepted to Honeypot, Shuhei received 5 interview invites from 5 companies. The process proved an eye-opening experience for Shuhei, who was previously unfamiliar with the European tech scene:</p><blockquote><p>“Honestly, when I registered at Honeypot, I didn&#39;t know anything about German companies. It was great that Zalando offered me an interview and throughout the interview process, I found it an interesting company.”</p></blockquote><p>Shuhei says he was drawn to Honeypot because of the transparency of the process.  Along with his potential salary he could see details about the companies’ tech stacks and cultures:</p><blockquote><p>“I liked Honeypot because companies offer interviews with minimum salary. It saved a lot of effort. Otherwise, I had to apply for jobs, do interviews, get offers, and finally find out that salary didn&#39;t meet my requirement. Also, my Talent Rep was very supportive and responsive. I had dozens of questions and she answered each of them very quickly.”</p></blockquote><p><img src='/assets/images/shuhei.png' alt='japanese-software-developer-germany'></p><p>Shuhei accepted Zalando’s offer and now works for them as a Frontend Engineer:</p><blockquote><p>“Zalando is currently moving from its old architecture to a new frontend-microservices-architecture called <a target='_blank' href='https://www.mosaic9.org/'>Mosaic</a>, which I think pretty unique.

It&#39;s interesting to work in such a big change, and also work with a lot of traffic.”</p></blockquote><p>Knowing that Shuhei was happy in his new job, we saved the hardest question for last. As a serious beer connoisseur, what&#39;s his favourite German beer so far?</p><blockquote><p>“It&#39;s a tough question! My all time favorite is Shiga Kogen from Japan. I&#39;m still exploring German beers, but my favorite so far is IPAs from Straßenbräu in Berlin.”</p></blockquote>",

Inspired by Chinese I Ching, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz devised the version of binary we use to this day.  Base 2 binary has only two possible values 0 and 1.  The standardized counting system we use around the globe is base 10, because there are 10 possible values.  A Base-2 binary system is suited towards a computer because each of the many circuits in a computer have two states: on and off.  Leibniz is one  of the most respected German computer scientists ever.  </p><h3 id='first-programmable-computer-1941'>First Programmable Computer (1941)</h3><p>In complete isolation, Konrad Zuse completed the first electromechanical programmable computer in 1941. Zuse, who was bored by routine calculations, set out to build a machine that was capable of doing these for him. His completed “Z3” was able to do basic math and was programmable with punched film. What’s truly remarkable about Zuse’s invention is that he managed to build it with scarce resources during wartime. Unknown to Zuse, there were other people around the world attempting to build a similar calculating machine but the standard methodology relied on a notoriously unreliable rotary decimal system. By contrast, Konrad built his own from the ground up using a floating binary system. He went on to found the world’s first computing company which is largely recognized as the world’s first startup.</p><h3 id='lcd-1968'>LCD (1968)</h3><p>After George H Heilmeier completed his PHD at Princeton University, he joined a research team working with liquid crystals. Though he wasn’t the one to discover liquid crystals, or the person who realized they reacted to different voltage by turning different covers, he was the person who overcame the liquid crystals limitations and sensitivities to create the first liquid crystal display. (LCD) This technology was immediately applied to the development of digital watches and only much later was applied to the  big screen TVs that we associate with LCD today.</p><h3 id='the-chip-card-1977'>The Chip Card (1977)</h3><p>Born out of the desire for a more secure credit card, German inventors Jürgen Dethloff and Helmut Göttrup spent nine years developing the chip card. Their card, which contained a built in programmable microprocessor, is the ancestor of our mobile, credit, and debit cards, and even the chips in our passports.</p><h3 id='mp3-1987'>MP3 (1987)</h3><p>The Fraunhofer-Institute, led by the renowned German computer scientist, Karlheinz Brandenburg, developed the MP3 when they were originally working on a way to increase the quality of phone calls.  At first they developed a refrigerator sized machine that was able to reduce file size to 8% of the original, but they quickly realized that that really wasn’t convenient and that they needed and algorithm that could do the same thing.  Using Suzanne Vega’s infamous pop song “Tom’s Diner,” as a reference, Brandenburg eventually cracked the algorithm after tens of thousands of listens.  Compared to the CD, the mp3 offered up to a 90% reduction in data.  Whereas the CD could store 74 minutes of audio, the most basic of mp3 players could hold 74 hours of audio.  </p>",

Companies who are hiring developers from other countries must be recognized as a sponsor, which is a pretty simple process. They can then begin the procedure for getting developers the residence permit.</p><h4 id='1-become-a-sponsor-for-detailed-information-on-the-process-of-becoming-a-sponsor-check-the-immigrationa-and-naturalization-ind-site-here-are-the-basic-steps-you-must-take'>1. Become a sponsor: For detailed information on the process of becoming a sponsor check the <a target='_blank' href='https://ind.nl/en'>Immigrationa and Naturalization (IND) site</a>. Here are the basic steps you must take:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Meet Required Conditions:</strong> To become a recognised sponsor you must first make sure that your organisation meets the required conditions, which can be found on <a target='_blank' href='https://ind.nl/en/work/Pages/Recognition_as_a_sponsor.aspx'>the IND website</a>. All prospective sponsors must be registered in the trade register, have no issues with bankruptcy or debt payment, and anyone involved with the organisation must be deemed trustworthy. Further specific requirements may apply depending the nature of your organisation. </p></li><li><p><strong>Fill in the form and pay a fee:</strong> On the same website you will find the application form which you must complete and send to the IND, along with the required fee. The IND will begin the process once the fee has been paid. The <a target='_blank' href='https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Costs.aspx'>fee</a> for this process is €2,638 for startups and small businesses with no more than 50 employees, and €5,276 for larger companies. </p></li><li><p><strong>Include VOG:</strong> The IND may request a VOG (Certificate of Good Conduct). Companies must apply for a VOG RP (Certificate of Good Conduct for Legal Entities), via the Ministry of Security and Justice. This certificate examines your company’s corporate compliance with criminal law. The fee for this process is €41,35.</p></li><li><p><strong>Receive confirmation from IND:</strong> Once the IND has made a decision you will receive written notice. This usually happens within four weeks of your application.</p></li></ul><h4 id='2-figure-out-if-your-developer-needs-an-entry-permit'>2. Figure out if your developer needs an Entry Permit</h4><ul><li><p>Depending on which country the developer comes from, you may need to prepare a provisional residence permit, <em>Machtiging tot Voorlopig Verblijf</em>, or MVV for short.

Recently though, we’ve been investing in a lot more specialized solutions to support our printing services in checking models for faults. Finding backend engineers with experience in geometric analysis and 3D printing, as well as related areas like CNC machining and injection molding, was very difficult for us. We ended up <a target='_blank' href='https://www.3dhubs.com/press/3d-hubs-acquires-printivate'>acquiring Printivate</a>, a service for optimizing and fixing 3D models.

For tooling and smaller projects we like to experiment with technologies a bit outside of our comfort zone, like Node.js, Elixir, and AWS Lambda.To get rid of the heaviest grunt work, our DevOps squad set up a fully automated Docker environment. After each push to GitHub, the automated testing, linting, and building kicks in. Then we can deploy in a single line using a home-built script.

The challenge is making sure we have the latest materials and technologies available so engineers and designers using 3D Hubs can get the right part for their specific function in the material with the best properties for the job.</p><p>As for technological challenges, moving a large part of our application to a completely new platform comes with a heap of challenges. How do we map our current domain to code? How do we make a platform that’s simple to understand for new developers, but powerful and robust enough for expansion?

Using locally recycled material, these machines would produce designs tailored to your needs. The need for shipping would disappear and your products would be a short bicycle ride away, at the friendly Hub around the corner.</p><p>We truly feel local manufacturing services have the potential to eliminate waste, pollution from transport and long shipping lead times, all of which are relics of centralized production.

Kerry  leads CB Insights&#39; autotech newsletter and mobility research, tracking startup developments, investments, and emerging business models across the automotive, transportation, and logistics industries. In this interview, Kerry talks to Honeypot about the state of AutoTech in America and Germany and what strategies large automakers are employing to attract software developers.</p><p><strong><em>Note: This interview was conducted in February 2017.</em></strong> </p><p><strong>If you had to describe the state of AutoTech in one word, what would it be?</strong></p><p>I think the best word you could use to describe AutoTech in the States right now would be hectic or chaotic. I’m sure you saw Ford recently took a billion dollar stake in an AI driving company. It’s certainly still difficult to see who will be pulling ahead of the pack, especially in terms of the incumbent automakers. </p><p>American automakers, as well as the Germans and the Japanese, are all looking to place a stake in this up-and-coming market. They’re scrambling to look for ways to make up for deficiencies or shortcomings they might have especially on software development, machine learning, all of those angles. </p><p>The automakers are looking for talent. A lot of players are still open, in that they are exploring a lot of different business models from robo taxis and car sharing, to new ownership paradigms, so there are a lot of questions open on the table. In sum, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty and hecticness. Its definitely an interesting state in the industry right now.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/1-auto-tech-annual-funding-2016.png' alt='autotech-in-germany'></p><p><strong>For sure, it seems like there’s a land grab going on with the big carmakers trying to get their hands onto as much intellectual property as possible.  Which organization do you think is most prepared to shape the future of autonomous driving?</strong> </p><p>I think land grab is a very good way to characterise it at this stage with a lot of them being stealthy and perhaps opportunistic as well. There’s a few billion dollar deals going around - look at this recent Ford deal with Argo. </p><p>Overall, Google - or now the Waymo programme - is in the best position, despite the troubles they’ve had lately with personnel departure. They have the longest tenure in urban driving or autonomous driving effort that’s out there and they’ve certainly amassed the largest pool of high fidelity data. They are certainly the party with the most data and experience.</p><p><strong>How does Tesla compare to Google in terms of their autonomous driving capability?</strong> </p><p>I don’t know if you would count Tesla in there with Google. Tesla has milage but Google’s data is richer.  Tesla have a fair amount of experience with their autopilot and their semi-autonomous system, but Tesla tester suites aren’t as robust. Their data pool is not as refined or as valuable as their broad numbers may make it seem.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/mobility-wheel.png' alt='autotech-in-germany'></p><h2 id='check-out-our-wheel-of-german-autotech'>Check out our <a target='_blank' href='https://autotechmap.honeypot.io/'>Wheel of German AutoTech.</a></h2><p><strong>If you were to look at traditional automakers, who do you think is the most advanced?</strong></p><p>Traditional automakers were taking a more incremental approach until all the hype around autonomy and tech companies triggered a rush towards full autonomy. </p><p>If we think about some of the more traditional automakers, I would say the most competitive is probably Daimler with Mercedes. In terms of their driving assist systems, it’s probably the closest to autopilot. </p><p>American automakers are scrambling to make blockbuster acquisitions, like GM with Cruise and now Ford with Argo. The Cruise programme released some videos from the street with impressive driving footage in San Francisco. Having a San Francisco office and retaining the Cruise brand would obviously help them recruit the talent you need for this type of challenge.</p><p><strong>If you speak to people in the industry there’s a sense that not everyone is founding a company with the intent of building a sustainable business, what do you say to that?</strong></p><p>To a certain extent, this could be true. It could be a group of experts or researchers standing together sort of optimistically, not to name any names. With any new space I think that’s a little inevitable that you’ll see those opportunistic players popping up. </p><p>It’s a challenge for both investors and existing automakers who are looking for acquisitions or investment targets to tease out who is really a team dedicated to this problem of autonomy and who is looking to capitalise off a panicking automaker or something along those lines. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/2-auto-tech-deal-share-global-2016.png' alt='autotech-in-germany'></p><p><strong>There is a lot of collaboration between the German automakers. Daimler recently announced a partnership with Uber. HERE is also owned by Daimler, BMW, Audi, and Intel. What do you make of this trend? Do you think there will be more partnerships like that, more consolidation?</strong> </p><p>I definitely think German automakers have been good at swallowing their pride. They realised where the deficiencies and talent gaps might lie. </p><p>I think the Daimler deal with Uber is a really good example. They also seem to have the most diverse strategy when it comes to finding a partner for ride-hailing. They have myTaxi and the moovel subsidiary that they’ve established for these next generation mobility services, or however you like to brand them. </p><p>They’ve also invested in Blacklane, I believe they have a majority stake in Hailo to add to their portfolio, so they have a range of homegrown ride-hailing solutions. Then they also go and pen this deal with Uber, so it seems like they’ve hedged their bets in many directions which is very interesting to see.  </p><p>Certainly of all the automakers, Daimler have positioned themselves in a way that they have a plan A and a plan B, you can see those different scenarios playing out. </p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the strategy of other large German automakers?</strong> </p><p>Not all the German automakers are making huge splashy startup acquisitions as some of the American ones have, but certainly they’re looking for creative solutions and different types of alliances that will help them. You can see this with the hardware and talent. All automakers are struggling to bring on board thousands of software engineers. Hiring that many tech qualified engineers out of the blue is arguably the biggest challenge they face. I think there’s been a lot of creative solutions thus far and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it continuing going forward.</p><p><strong>Who do you think will be able to live up to the splashy predictions that have been made? Ford, for instance, want to have fully autonomous vehicles in mass production by 2021, do you think at the current rate that this is possible? What are some challenges that are ahead for AutoTech to reach this futuristic vision?</strong></p><p>That is the question, right? And a lot of automakers, startups and tech companies are making these types of predictions about 2019, 2020, 2021. Somewhere around that time frame they’re promising that they will have full autonomy.  Obviously that’s a number of years out, but I think we will achieve it. </p><p>I think it’s a realistic goal to achieve level 4 autonomy, which is right below the highest level, level 5. What level 4 means is that a vehicle will be capable of fully autonomous driving without human interaction, within defined spaces. So this could be specific urban areas. Let’s just take Ford as a specific example, in certain towns the car is totally capable of handling its own driving because they’ve pre-vetted it, or mapped out the streets in enough detail for full autonomy. But outside of that zone it may not be fully autonomous.</p><p>I think many players have been careful not to comment on full autonomy as in, ‘this car will autonomously drive you to any destination that you wish. I think if you look at the language, they’ve been wording things carefully because it’s obviously a very different scenario to account for every single type of terrain, road, weather condition, whether an area has been pre-mapped or not. I would be very impressed if anyone could tackle all of those problems within a 4 or 5 year timeframe. </p><p><strong>You mentioned that all of the big auto players are talking about hiring as being one of their main challenges, have you seen any special strategies among automotive players or autotech startups in terms of hiring?</strong></p><p>That’s a really good question. The Argo deal with Ford is the most creative strategy that we’ve seen thus far. Ford bought Argo, but they’re allowing it to retain a significant level of independence as well as issue its own equity. We’ve seen reports that Argo are reserving their own right to IPO as well. All of those moves - and their CEO references this directly in the press release - are being made to attract and retain the talent, which has been such a major problem for them.</p><p>If this startup can maintain its own identity, issue its own equity, and perhaps have its own IPO or path to that sort of exit, those are all things that will really help them when trying to lure developers to the table, things that a traditional automaker hiring directly couldn’t do. So I think that’s a very creative solution. GM’s Cruise deal is not quite as interesting of a structure but I think is still along the same lines of retaining a startup’s brand of independence.</p><p><strong>What do you think are the very distinctive skills of software developers who would be working in the industry?</strong></p><p>In terms of what skills software developers would need, that encompasses everything from machine learning, computer vision, to just ingesting and distilling the massive data sets that are coming out of these autonomous driving vehicles and interpreting them. There’s a number of startups that are purely working on a data layer on top of the autonomous systems themselves, so I think there are a lot of opportunities there as well. </p><p>I’m sure you might have seen programmes like Udacity, the education startup who are creating their own self-driving nano degrees, or training programmes that are helping developers adapt to these sort of skills and things they might need on the fly. Certainly coming at it from a lot of angles. Automakers are getting creative with a lot of hiring strategies and different education and professional development startups coming in to serve the needs of developers who might want to learn some sort of skill for this industry. </p>",

      "contents": "<p>Dutch tech company <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bynder.com/'>Bynder</a> began life as a side project in a web agency. The difficulty of image-transfer led the founders to develop their own digital asset management software, which today is used by more than 150,000 brand managers, marketers and creatives globally. We talk to Bynder CTO, <a target='_blank' href='https://nl.linkedin.com/in/keijzer'>Roland Keijzer</a> about their modern tech stack and the joys of having offices in three of Europe’s coolest cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Barcelona. </p><h3 id='hi-roland-how-did-bynder-get-started'>Hi Roland! How did Bynder get started?</h3><p>That’s actually a nice story! It all started with Label A, a company founded by Chris, Stefan and myself back in 2008. We were a web agency and built all kinds of websites, applications and also more complex projects. We had a client, a distributor of alcoholic beverages, who wanted a database for their images and marketing materials. These digital assets used to be shared using an ftp drive or they would even be delivered by a bike courier, so we were asked to create a more modern solution. </p><p>We created a digital asset management (DAM) tool, without really being aware of it. Then this need started popping up everywhere; more and more clients were requesting something very similar. This concept was very powerful, and we gradually came to understand the value and the potential of it - every company doing marketing (i.e. basically every company) could use a tool like this.</p><h3 id='your-product-grew-out-of-a-real-problem-felt-by-a-client-how-did-bynder-develop-after-that'>Your product grew out of a real problem felt by a client. How did Bynder develop after that?</h3><p>The first two years we didn’t do too much with the DAM itself, but because it was such a new technology and had strong features, we signed some very good customers. Soon after, we decided to put more effort into our DAM than we had before, and we separated DAM from Label A and started hiring the first employees. That was the birth of Bynder. </p><p>With Bynder, we have always been a SaaS product and it has always grown through the needs of the customers. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/bynder-one.jpg' alt='bynder-jobs'></p><h3 id='how-has-your-tech-stack-changed-in-that-time'>How has your tech stack changed in that time?</h3><p>We were on a virtual server at the very beginning, but we quickly switched to S3, EC2, SQS, RDS and all these services from Amazon.</p><h3 id='what-were-the-unforeseen-technical-challenges-in-scaling-bynder'>What were the unforeseen technical challenges in scaling Bynder?</h3><p>Back in the days, Bynder didn’t start in the cloud in the strictest sense, but on a virtual server. A very simple, 200GB server. The thing with images is that the file sizes can be pretty large. Everything went well when we had a small amount of clients but when we started to grow, we were confronted with some issues. When you have ten customers uploading 100GB footage, at some point you will have to replace your hard drives. Replacing a hard drive on a server means downtime so that is why we looked for other solutions and eventually chose to work with Amazon Web Services and their ‘unlimited’ storage. This way we could fully focus on our customers and their needs without paying full time attention to our hardware. </p><p>Also, our clients can download files or select particular files and download them as ZIP files. This is very processor-intensive because every customer puts together his own package of files. Therefore, we decided to create a special microservice. This microservice has the ability to scale up automatically when needed. Before that, problems would arise when a customer would send out an email and all recipients would start to download at the same time. The workload was too heavy which caused our server to go down. The problem of too many users requesting heavy tasks at the same time is solved through these microservices. From that day, the scale of our service became unlimited.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/bynder-two.jpg' alt='bynder-jobs'></p><h3 id='what-are-the-features-you-are-particularly-proud-of'>What are the features you are particularly proud of?</h3><p>The way we generate previews, because there are many exotic file types out there. Sometimes these are very complex and with sizes up to 10GB for a single image. We used to have problems with this in terms of scale and quality, but we’ve taken huge strides to generate previews in so many different formats. More generally, I would say we are pretty good UX/UI-wise. </p><p>Thinking more broadly, our UX and UI have and will remain one of the signatures of our software. I think this is because of our roots as a web agency, we have a focus on UX/UI and we have a design-first approach. We are always concerned with the end user, and we also realize that usability is the quickest path to widespread adoption of the tool, so we’ve doubled down on that.</p><h3 id='you-mentioned-previously-that-scaling-your-engineering-team-has-been-a-challenge-what-are-you-doing-to-deal-with-that'>You mentioned previously that scaling your engineering team has been a challenge. What are you doing to deal with that?</h3><p>We added a second office dedicated to development, this time in Barcelona. The talent pool there is tremendous, and it’s good to add new perspectives to the team. We have 15 employees now in Spain and we found out that it is important to have them operate autonomously. We work in squads of maximum 8 people: backend, frontend, QA and product owner, focusing on certain parts of Bynder. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/bynder-three.jpg' alt='bynder-jobs'></p><h3 id='why-do-developers-want-to-work-for-bynder'>Why do developers want to work for Bynder?</h3><p>A number of things. Our offices are centrally located: we are at Plaça de Catalunya in Barcelona, on Blaak in Rotterdam and practically on Leidseplein in Amsterdam. For developers specifically, I’d say we are attractive because we work with new technologies. We are currently building a single page application with React and Redux as frontend frameworks, we build our backend in Python and work with a GraphQL API. Everything is hosted on AWS. We are actually one of the top 3 clients of Amazon in the Benelux so we are also involved in the development of new features and products and we are invited to run new services in Beta with them.</p><h3 id='what-is-your-vision-for-the-development-of-the-product-over-the-next-couple-of-years'>What is your vision for the development of the product over the next couple of years?</h3><p>The technologies we work with are future proof. The focus will be on integrating AI to a greater extent. For example: when users are tagging pictures, we will use machine learning technologies to give more precise suggestions in queries and in the upload process. Many clients currently employ librarians to do digital asset management and manage all the graphic material in a company.</p><p>Bynder can help automate this more. For example, image recognition software can recognize faces. What kind of a picture is it? Which subjects are in it? The software itself is developed in-house. These kinds of ideas are brought forward or picked up by our team, then they make a nice proof of concept. If we like it and see the value of it, we take the idea further. That’s the startup culture or the agile way of working we (still) have. </p>",

We interviewed Blendle’s CTO Jean Mertz and talked about how the Utrecht-based tech startup combines journalism and technology, how they maintain a polyglot development environment and why it&#39;s so fun to work there as a developer.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/cto-blendle.png' alt='CTO Blendle'></p><h3 id='how-did-you-end-up-at-blendle'>How did you end up at Blendle?</h3><p>I was watching De Wereld Draait Door (‘The World Keeps Turning’,  a Dutch television show) when I saw Alexander. [Klöpping, Founder &amp; CEO] I thought to myself that sounds like an interesting bunch, let’s see if they need developers. I jumped on the train, went to Utrecht to meet them, and got a really good feeling right from the start. We got to work on a few things together where I was able to demonstrate what I can do, and even got a chance to go out for lunch as a team. It was a nice way to get to know the company. That was a little over two years ago, after which I joined as a backend developer and a year later I became CTO.</p><h3 id='what-is-it-like-working-at-blendle'>What is it like working at Blendle?</h3><p>We are still kind of a startup, we’ve only existed for about 3.5 years. What defines us is a  combination of passion for technology and for journalism. Everything we do is focused on promoting quality journalism, especially with younger readers who rarely experience this kind of journalism. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/blendle.jpg' alt='Everyday material at Blendle'></p><h3 id='what-technologies-do-you-work-with'>What technologies do you work with?</h3><p>We make a clear distinction between the backend (from where the API is being served) and the clients who use the API. We have a Ruby backend that serves the API, a ReactJS frontend for the website, a SWIFT code base for the iOS app and a Java/Kotlin codebase for the Android app. As a result, everyone can work separately if needed but also can keep in touch with each other to ensure that API communication is always good and being developed.</p><h3 id='when-blendle-started-you-had-your-own-hardware-on-which-your-applications-ran-how-has-your-infrastructure-changed-in-that-time'>When Blendle started, you had your own hardware on which your applications ran. How has your infrastructure changed in that time?</h3><p>We slowly moved to the cloud and more recently we made a transition to Kubernetes. This has enabled teams to be very much in control of the infrastructure they work with. It also makes it possible for teams to develop very independently while keeping in touch with each other to communicate about new features or cross team implementations or cross component implementations.</p><p>We also strive for continuous delivery, which we have done from the outset and we continue to work on. We have about 20 to 40 releases a day. So that means that when someone makes a pull request, there are two colleagues who need to approve it, then it goes straight to master and to production. Our continuous delivery platform is built on top of Kubernetes so that we can scale indefinitely. We strive to keep testing under two minutes, preferably within a couple of seconds. It’s funny to see when people start to work here, some think: &#39;holy shit&#39; when I click on merge, it will go to production and to those hundreds of thousands of people reading articles.</p><h3 id='why-is-it-interesting-for-developers-to-work-at-blendle'>Why is it interesting for developers to work at Blendle?</h3><p>In general, we encourage a polyglot development environment. For example, we wrote our mailer in Golang because we needed performance in that area. We had to generate thousands of personal newsletters in 5 to 6 minutes, we could not make this happen reliably with Ruby in such a short time. We also wrote a piece of our backend in Node.js.</p><p>As a team, we look at the problem and make the right technology choices.That makes it a lot of fun. As a result, a developer at Blendle can work with multiple languages and colleagues teach each other new languages. So, I think that is a beautiful thing about Blendle.</p><p>We also have our &quot;Bleativity Day&quot;, which we have twice a month, for an entire day. All Blendle employees work on something cool  that may or may not be work-related. On these special days, you can feel the energy when you walk around the office. </p><h3 id='how-does-blendle-suggest-articles-to-readers'>How does Blendle suggest articles to readers?</h3><p>We have a team of 8 machine learning specialists who are constantly improving the models to make the best selections of articles for our readers. Also, we are adding new input that should help determine what&#39;s interesting for you. For example, if you indicate that you are interested in sports, this will be considered in selecting which articles are of interest to you. But we can also look at your reading behavior; what articles you clicked on, how long you read them, and how far you scrolled down after opening an article. With approval, we also incorporate Twitter and  Facebook into our analysis. What’s being read in social environments can also be used in our algorithm.</p><p>We are very aware of the filter bubble effect that can be the result of these algorithms so we continue to look for ways to make the selection even better for you, while at the same time trying to ensure that you will not get stuck in your bubble. That&#39;s why we also have the must-reads; three articles chosen by the editorial team which you will be shown, no matter the preferences you indicated. The goal is to show our readers exactly the articles they would like to read, promoting quality journalism and bringing our readers what they want every morning.</p><h3 id='what-do-you-look-for-in-developers-you-hire-for-blendle'>What do you look for in developers you hire for Blendle?</h3><p>We have three components that we look for: Work, Drive and Fit. These components all have the same weight for us when we consider hiring someone. First, the component Work: how good are you in your job, what can you contribute to Blendle? What can you teach your colleagues? Second, what is your ambition, where do you want to go? How passionate are you in your profession. That’s the Drive aspect. Third, Fit. Do you fit with Blendle culturally? Do you have a startup mindset? It’s not a 9 to 5 job, you have a lot of freedom but we also have high standards concerning the output we expect from our employees. Finding someone with the right combination of these three elements is very difficult. We do not require you to have a passion for journalism but you do need to be passionate about making a product like Blendle.</p>",

For the hiring process from the HR side, check out our <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/7-ways-to-improve-your-hiring-practices-when-recruiting-developers/'>blog on best methods in hiring and recruiting developers</a>. Here are our tips for developers to succeed at both phone and non-technical interviews.</p><h3 id='1-do-your-homework'>1. Do your Homework</h3><p>Learn as much as you can about the company and the role you applied for and try to get an understanding of their culture. This will give you clues as to what the company is expecting from you, and can shape the way you present yourself. </p><p>Find out who is going to be interviewing you. Knowing the role of the person who will interview you will give you key insights as to the kind of questions you can expect. Check out their LinkedIn profile, see where they worked before and try to read articles they have written. </p><p>Decide what you will wear to the interview ahead of time. The best way to see what style is most appropriate is to check employee pictures on the company’s website. Most startups are casual, so it’s fine not to dress up!</p><h3 id='2-phone-interviews'>2. Phone Interviews</h3><p>For interviews over the phone, you may not think about the need to dress up. However, wearing an appropriate work outfit can help you get into the right mindset for your interview, even if you won’t be seen. Also, there is the slight chance that the interviewer may request to switch things up last minute and ask to Skype you. </p><p>Having your phone fully charged is also a great idea because most interviews last forty-five minutes or more. You don’t want to be worried about your phone dying during your interview.</p><p>Lastly, the fact that you will not be able to see the interviewer and that they will not be able to see you will directly affect how you can communicate. Be sure to speak clearly and deliberately in order to be understood. Anticipate having trouble to hear and understand the interviewer, especially if they have an accent. Don’t be afraid to ask them to repeat something if it is not clear. </p><p>Having your phone set to loudspeaker may be more comfortable for you, but may make it more difficult to understand the person on the other end. Also be sure to alert anyone that you are living with what time you will have the interview and to avoid loud noises including using the smoothie mixer and washing machine. This will only make it harder for the interviewer to hear you and can easily distract you. </p><h3 id='3-motivation'>3. Motivation</h3><p>Companies don’t just want you for your technical skills. They want a motivated employee who will fit into the company vision and way of doing things. Consider what makes you want to work for this company and contribute to its success. Also ponder how your personal interests align with company values. </p><p>To better understand the company’s future goals, check out their current projects, their “About Page”, Crunchbase, LinkedIn and other social sites. Doing this allows you to see what they value and consider important. Mention which of their projects appealed to you during your interview.</p><h3 id='4-strengths-and-weaknesses'>4. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p>Bragging about yourself is a necessary part of the interview process. While no-one is perfect, you have got to be the one to really highlight what you are capable of and what you have already accomplished. If you don’t do it, who will? </p><p>And you can bet that other applicants are doing their best to convince the company to hire them by inflating past achievements. Knowing what makes you uniquely qualified for the position will allow you to accurately and honestly describe what a great addition you would make to the company. Think about your strengths in advance and don’t be afraid to present them.</p><p>When asked to describe a weakness, craft your answer carefully. You want to show honest self-reflection while pointing out steps you have taken to rectify or improve current shortcomings. </p><h3 id='5-self-reflection-current-projects-and-experience'>5. Self-reflection, Current Projects and Experience</h3><p>If you already have a job, use projects that you are already working on to outline what experience you have. Think about how you have dealt with and overcome challenges in your current position. </p><p>If you aren’t currently working, take time to consider what past projects or achievements have shaped your work ethic. Consider how you would use this experience to improve the company you are applying for.</p><p>For non-technical interviews, try to explain your role in these projects and the team setup. Rather than focusing on technical implementation, draw out how the feature impacted the business through key metrics, like conversion rates, sessions, or other such metrics.</p><h3 id='6-workflow'>6. Workflow</h3><p>Be ready to describe how you work. Companies expect you to be able to work in a team, so have a few examples prepared of times that you successfully accomplished a group project.</p><p>Initiative is attractive to companies because it shows independence and someone who is invested in what they do. Explaining situations where you took the initiative and where you dealt with difficult tasks, will give the interviewer an idea of how you might fit in with their company. </p><h3 id='7-use-examples'>7. Use Examples</h3><p>Every candidate will proclaim that they are hard-working and the right fit for the position. Solid examples from your past experience is a great way to stand out and prove that what you say about yourself is true. Think of examples that underline your skills and past experiences. Expect your claims to be challenged, and be ready to back them up! </p><h3 id='8-be-curious---ask-questions'>8. Be curious - Ask Questions!</h3><p>Prepare some questions for the interviewers  - be curious about the company and the team, as well as the position. Show them that you understand the role, are eager to learn more and excited to contribute to the team and company’s success. </p><p>When asked if you would like to ask the company something, never say no! This is a sure way of coming across uninterested or lazy to the interviewer. However, don’t just ask any question, think about something that you couldn’t easily find on their website. </p><p>Feel free to ask questions like, how do you see me fitting into the role? What are the future plans for growth for the company? What are the biggest challenges you face and how can I help? Personality over perfection </p><p>Preparation is key but having a positive attitude and being open to new challenges is also crucial. <strong>If you don’t know an answer right away, demonstrate how you would go about finding a solution, while explaining your approach.</strong> This will define your character and show self-confidence. </p><p><strong>Good luck with your next interview!</strong></p><hr><p><em>As a former a Talent Representative at Honeypot, I worked with a lot of developers, guiding them through our platform and assisting them throughout the interview process with numerous companies.

It is intended to be used as a means of reimbursing the employee for costs incurred through the relocation process. However, neither the employee nor employer is required to provide proof of any costs incurred in order to prove eligibility. Here is our breakdown of what is required and how it works:</p><h3 id='30-dutch-tax-ruling-application-requirements'>30% Dutch Tax Ruling Application Requirements</h3><p><strong>1.</strong>  You must have spent the last two years living at least 150 km from the Netherlands.  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/living_and_working/working_in_another_country_temporarily/you_are_coming_to_work_in_the_netherlands/30_facility_for_incoming_employees/conditions_30_p_facility/you_live_more_than_150_kilometres_away_from_the_dutch_border'>exceptions</a> to this rule for anyone that has completed a PhD.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Though this program is marketed as a program for expats with in-demand skillsets. <strong>These expert skillsets are not listed on the application, nor are they defined by industry or qualification.</strong> They are defined by your salary.  </p><p>More specifically you qualify for the exemption if you make over €37,000 after the 30% tax reduction.  This decreases if you are under the age of 30 and possess a Master’s degree, to €28,125.   If you are working in the Netherlands at a research institution conducting scientific research, you are entitled to the 30% ruling regardless of your salary.</p><p> For example, assume the gross annual salary of a developer is €100,000 before the 30% rule is applied. The employee and employer can agree to pay 30% of this amount as a tax free allowance, €30,000, meaning the taxable gross salary remaining is €70,000. As long as the remaining taxable gross salary is above the required €37,000, you&#39;re eligible. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> If approved, the ruling has a term of 5 years.

Both cities offer great market reach along with reliable funding sources.

The metropolis isn’t just about startups - the inner city alone is home to an estimated 40,000 tech companies. A recent parliamentary report estimates that the shortage of digital skills costs the UK economy £63 billion per year. Needless to say, software developers in London are in high demand.</p><p>The size of the city means there are plenty of opportunities to keep up-to-date on tech trends, there are hundreds of meet-ups dedicated to almost every technology and at least 10 big conferences each year.  London is a hub for talented people from around the world, meaning if you are motivated to learn, this could be the city for you. Developers considering London will get higher salaries than elsewhere, but also can expect a higher cost of living. </p><h3 id='amsterdam'>Amsterdam</h3><p>The city of canals has a ton to offer: Amsterdam itself is famous for great bars and nightlife while corporations such as Uber, Tesla, Elastic and Atlassian have major offices here. </p><p>Amsterdam also boasts a history of tech innovation. Home grown, well established software and security companies, such as Gemalto, Xebia, AVG Technologies, Schuberg Philis and TomTom are a testament to that culture of innovation. In 2015, the Netherlands ranked 4th on the Global Innovation Index. More recent editions to Amsterdam’s portfolio include Bright Computing, Pyramid Analytics and Wercker. Our <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/amsterdam-tech-map/'>Amsterdam Tech Map</a> demonstrates more of the advantages Amsterdam has for international developers, such as the 2nd highest non-native English proficiency globally. </p><h3 id='berlin'>Berlin</h3><p>Once nicknamed the &#39;poorest capital of Europe&#39; Berlin is now a European heaven for European startups - and it remains a cheap place to live. Software Developers are in huge demand in Berlin and while salaries won&#39;t match what you would find in London or Amsterdam, but the cheaper cost of living means that the quality of life can actually be higher. Berlin is also beginning to rival London in terms of innovative conferences. Berlin is home to the first European editions of <a target='_blank' href='https://graphql-europe.org/'>GraphQL-</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://2016.rustfest.eu/'>Rust-focused</a> conferences.

European companies hope to take advantage of the tech talent increase by adding new individuals with tech skills their teams may have been missing.</p><p>European countries offer incentives for technology specialists to come into the workforce.

There are all kinds of smaller companies here; ranging from bio-tech to startups focused on helping corporations digitalize. There are numerous niche companies designed to fulfill one specific role or problem and a lot of investors in the ecosystem, which means a ton of potential to find support for startups. Cologne is very centralized. The state borders both the Netherlands and Belgium and offers quick access to both northern and southern Germany.

Adblock Plus is our most famous product with more than 100 million devices using it. All of our co-founders knew about Cologne and the environment here before founding Eyeo GmbH. Cologne is a good place for us because it is very centrally located, with the Frankfurt International Airport less than an hour away. Cologne makes sense for us because we have a new big office here and we plan on staying here for the foreseeable future. I think that there are several interesting startups in Cologne.

For people considering starting a tech career, one thing to keep in mind is that there are many different sides to working in tech. These include the business side (marketing and sales) and even graphic design. You don&#39;t need to know how to program or code. There is probably a space for you in this field and you shouldn&#39;t be intimidated if you don&#39;t have a tech background. &quot; %}</p><p>{% include quote-author.html  author-name=&quot;Salvatore Vacante&quot;  description=&quot;Co-Founder at Shoppi, London&quot;  author-image=&quot;salvatore_vacanti.jpg&quot;  quote=&quot;I love the spirit of Pirate Summit. This is a great venue, a cool conference. Crazy, but cool. You can create a lot of connections, with other startups and investors. I think this is a unique thing they are doing here. The ecosystem in Cologne is interesting and open, you can make a lot of connections very quickly. I think Cologne is definitely growing in technology, because of the potential for B2B startups.&quot; %}</p><p>  {% include quote-author.html  author-name=&quot;Sigurd Jaiser&quot;  description=&quot;Sipgate GmbH, Dusseldorf&quot;  author-image=&quot;sigurd_jaiser.png&quot;  quote=&quot;I find it wonderful in Dusseldorf.

It’s not as expensive as Munich, Hamburg, or Stuttgart. There are many jobs in Dusseldorf for developers. There are meetups for data scientists, web developers, and Google developers. This gives you the chance to exchange ideas and knowledge. Dusseldorf is a great option for developers.&quot; %}</p><p>{% include quote-author.html  author-name=&quot;Malte Goesche&quot;  description=&quot;Platform Partnerships Manager for Facebook, Berlin&quot;  author-image=&quot;malte_Facebook.jpg&quot;  quote=&quot;We recently started Developer Circles as a program designed to empower communities of developers to connect and learn from each other. The Circles are locally organized groups and meetups where developers come together to engage with experts, learn about new tech and even build technology and apps with other developers.

      "contents": "<h2 id='honeypot-advanced-search'>Honeypot Advanced Search</h2><p>Today we are releasing Advanced Search functionality on Honeypot Search to help you find developers, data scientists and other tech talent quickly and efficiently. </p><p>Before jumping into the new functionality, let me explain some search terminology - terms and operators.  </p><ul><li>A <strong>term is the word you are searching for</strong>: it can be a single word  —  <code>java</code> — or a phrase, surrounded by double quotes  —  <code>&quot;product owner&quot;</code> — which searches for all the words in the phrase, in the same order.</li><li>An <strong>operator allows you to customize a search</strong>. Without applying any operators, the <strong>default search will return OR: for example, a search for</strong> <code>java scala ruby</code> <strong>will return any profile that contains one or more reference to</strong> <code>java OR scala OR ruby</code>. This will return the maximum amount of developer profiles possible. </li></ul><p>So, here’s the exciting part. </p><p>You can now add power to your search by using the Boolean search operators, which are listed below: </p> <br /> <h2 id='boolean-search-operators-on-honeypot'>Boolean Search Operators on Honeypot</h2> <br /> <p>|:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|| Phrase Searches &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | <code>&quot;Product Owner&quot;</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | This search will return profiles containing exactly this term in exactly this order. <br /><br /> || NOT Searches <br />  | <code>Scala NOT Java</code>   | To exclude a particular term, type that term with an <strong>uppercase</strong> <code>NOT</code> immediately before it. For example, type: <code>scala NOT java</code> and you will get Scala developers but not Java developers <br /><br /> || OR Searches    | <code>Scala OR Java</code>  | To see results that include at least one or more terms, use an <strong>uppercase OR</strong>. For example, type <code>scala OR java</code> and you will see profiles that contain at least Scala or Java once. <strong>This operator gives you the broadest search results possible.</strong>  <br /><br /> || AND Searches | <code>Scala AND Java</code> | To get results that include minimum two or more terms, you can use the uppercase word <code>AND</code> as a separator. For example, type: <code>Scala AND Java</code> and you will get profiles which contain both terms. Remember,  <code>AND</code> means you are searching for profiles containing both of the words or values, not just one of them <br /><br /> |</p> <br /> <h2 id='even-more-advanced-operators'>Even more advanced operators!</h2> <br /> <p>|:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|| Preferred operators &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | <code>+product owner</code> <br /> <br /> <code>-product owner</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Similar to the above operators, you can use + and - in your search queries. <br /> <br />  +(this term must be present) and - (this term must not be present) <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> For example: <br /> <code>Java +product owner -PHP means</code> <br /> <br /> -<code>Product owner</code> must be present <br /> -<code>PHP</code> must not be present <br /> -<code>Java</code> is optional, but increases the relevance of the profile if it is present  <br /> <br /> || Parenthetical searches <br /> | “Product Owner”NOT <br /> (junior <br /> OR CTO) <br />    | To do a complex search, you can combine terms. For example, if you want to find a product owner, but want to exclude juniors and CTOs, you can type “Product Owner”NOT(junior OR CTO) <br /><br /> |</p><p> <br /> <br /> </p><p>These operators can become more complicated when used in combination and when used in particular orders. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precedence over OR. While the + and - only affect the term to the right of the operator, AND and OR can affect the terms to the left and right.</p><p>To overcome some potential difficulties in longer search queries, you can use Grouping. Multiple terms or clauses can be grouped together with parentheses, to form sub-queries:  (java OR scala) AND react. This would return profiles which have one or more reference to java or scala and at least one reference to react.</p><p>Honeypot Search allows you to find the best developers and tech talent on our platform. For additional support or to give us feedback, contact with your Customer Success Manager or drop us a line on <a target='_blank' href='mailto:hello@honeypot.io'>hello@honeypot.io</a>. </p><p>Otherwise, happy searching friends! </p>",

The increasing expenditure on HR and workforce-related products demonstrates the will to modernize - an effect which is spurred by demographic shifts and changes in workplace expectations.</p><br /> <p>In 2018, HR teams are focusing on employee experience, building team-driven environments, and employee integration. And as people analytics explodes so too does the need for HR teams to become data compliant. There’s never a dull moment in People Operations - here are my top five trends shaping Human Resources in 2018.</p><br /> <h2 id='employee-experience-contd'>Employee Experience, contd.</h2><p>Employee Experience integrates three core concepts: engagement, culture and performance management. The drivers of engagement and culture are complex, but continuous listening to employees and clear structures for performance management help companies to create inspiring environments.</p><br />  <p>According to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhigginbottom/2014/09/11/workplace-stress-leads-to-less-productive-employees/#58a61fe431d1'>research from Towers Watson</a>, stressed employees take an average of 4.6 sick days per year compared to 2.6 days for employees who have low levels of stress. Josh Bersin notes: </p><br /> <blockquote><p>“Well-run companies now understand that in a sense, employees are more important than customers— because when employees are managed effectively, customers tend to be happier. Employee engagement data, manager feedback, coaching, and social recognition are all different forms of feedback, so ultimately they belong in one place.”</p></blockquote><br /> <p>Employee engagement platforms (<a target='_blank' href='https://peakon.com/'>Peakon</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.qualtrics.com/'>Qualtrics</a>), pulse feedback tools (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.15five.com/'>15Five</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.cultureamp.com/'>Culture Amp</a>) employee wellness apps (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.castlighthealth.com/'>Castlight Health</a>) and productivity tools (<a target='_blank' href='https://evernote.com/intl/de/'>Evernote</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://trello.com/'>Trello</a>)  are becoming central to the modern HR stack. </p><br /> <p>Josh Bersin, a leading industry analyst with a focus on enterprise learning and talent management, recommends an <a target='_blank' href='https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/deloitte-review/issue-16/employee-engagement-strategies.html'>integrated approach to employee experience</a>. He considers meaningful work, hands-on management, a humane environment, growth opportunities and trust in leadership to be important pillars of employee engagement. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/integrated_approach.png' alt='An Integrated Approach to Employee Experience'></p><br /> <p>Bersin’s work is aimed at larger companies, but I find his framework useful even within smaller contexts. Honeypot still has a long way to go in terms of establishing a clear Employee Experience strategy, but we were able to set up some small initiatives which are helping us to learn as an organization.</p><br /> <p>We had a peer-lead management training for junior managers, which relied on <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aDChcr2W6r683bCUeOD-4FEP3sx754_n37-bSHPFw4/edit'>Google’s New Manager framework</a>. We took our Team Leads out of the office for two days for 11 sessions, which covered feedback, decision making, emotional intelligence and various other topics. We also had an external coach join for one meeting. It was a small initiative but we felt the impact. </p><br /> <p>Likewise, last year, as part of this integrated approach to employee experience, we introduced the exit interview at Honeypot. We base our <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/point-nine-news/exit-interviews-a58771573d6e'>exit interviews on the framework</a> laid out by Pawel Chudzinski from Point Nine Capital. As a founder, the exit interview is painful, but the insights we gain are invaluable. And we are using them to shape everything from employee engagement and career development to organizational design and process management.  One exit interview led to such a productive conversation that we ended signing a new work contract for a different position.</p><br /><h2 id='employee-onboarding-becomes-employee-integration'>Employee Onboarding becomes Employee Integration</h2><p>Onboarding employees into an organization is a key responsibility for People Operations teams. Onboarding can simply be the process of getting a new employee up to speed with admin-related tasks. Integration, on the other hand, goes deeper. </p><br /> <p>The Harvard Business Review <a target='_blank' href='https://hbr.org/2017/05/onboarding-isnt-enough'>identified five major tasks that senior leaders need to undertake in their first months of joining a company</a>: assuming operational leadership, taking charge of the team, aligning with stakeholders, engaging with the culture, and defining strategic intent. </p><br /> <p><img src='/assets/images/employee_onboarding.png' alt='Employee Onboarding evolves to Employee Integration'></p><br /> <p>At Honeypot, aside from the normal operational and administrative onboarding we have started to implement employee integration. </p><br /> <p>We make integration self-directed, with guidance and facilitation from myself and co-founder, Kaya. We give new senior management access to previous performance reviews of their team, we give them a list of people they should have in-depth interviews with, we invite them to meetings - and most of all we encourage criticism. At the end of four weeks, we ask them to prepare a SWOT analysis of the teams  for which they are assuming leadership. Once aligned, we do a mini-offsite, in which they get the chance to collaboratively shape their strategy.  </p><br /> <h2 id='team-management-at-the-centre-of-organizational-design'>Team Management at the Centre of Organizational Design</h2><p>Companies are increasingly operating as networks of teams, rather than in hierarchical, individual-focused structures.  These smaller, self-directed focused teams are the best way to tackle critical projects. Josh Bersin identified this shift as <a target='_blank' href='https://joshbersin.com/2017/11/hr-technology-in-2018-ten-disruptions-ahead/'>one of the core changes underway in the workplace</a>. He emphasizes the need for companies to evaluate not just structures but also software: </p><br /> <blockquote><p>“As companies replace hierarchical management with a networked team structure, we are going to be using new tools purpose-built for teams...In this new world, people may have multiple managers, work on multiple projects at once, and often “lend” or “sell” their time to others in the organization. Traditional talent management software was not designed for this world.” </p></blockquote><br /> <p>Startups have quickly adopted tools like Workplace by Facebook, Slack, and Trello. These tools often mirror social networking systems, allowing users workers to talk in groups.  Other tools, such as Applicant Tracking Systems, are focusing on integrations which facilitate greater team collaboration between hiring managers and recruiters. Honeypot recently <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/how-to-integrate-personio-and-honeypot/'>integrated into Personio</a> and other Applicant Tracking Systems, to encourage greater collaboration and facilitate teamwork. </p><br /> <h2 id='continuing-growth-of-people-analytics'>Continuing Growth of People Analytics</h2><p>People Analytics is far from a new topic in the HR world: tracking metrics around diversity, pay equity, skills gaps, and retention are well established. But organizations are now extending the type of data they are tracking to look at employee engagement and well-being. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2017/12/16/people-analytics-here-with-a-vengeance/#7188af1b32a1'>Forbes</a> notes: </p><br /> <blockquote><p>“Companies now also have near real-time data about employee engagement (coming from pulse surveys or continuous performance management tools), employee recognition (from social recognition systems), employee communications and teams (through organizational network analysis and email metadata analysis systems), travel and location (through time and expense, employee badge readers, or phone location data), employee wellbeing (through wellbeing applications and voluntary data shared about exercise and fitness), and even trust and employee sentiment (through “mood analysis” of survey responses and emails).”</p></blockquote><br /> <h2 id='focus-on-data-protection-laws'>Focus on Data Protection Laws</h2><p>Alongside broader People Analytics, comes greater responsibility for safe and fair data management practices. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is on the lips of most European recruitment teams currently. </p><br /> <p>The regulation is the result of four years of debate in the EU Parliament and is the most important change in data privacy in the last 20 years. The enforcement date is May 25th 2018. Organizations who are not compliant by that time will face heavy fines - up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 Million (whichever is greater). </p><br /> <p><img src='/assets/images/keys_recruitment.png' alt='5 Key Areas of GDPR for Recruitment'></p><br /> <p>Recruitment teams manage a lot of personal information about candidates. GDPR demands that candidate data is gathered, used, stored and disposed of according to its requirements. Many companies are deciding to hire a Data Protection Officer to help maintain compliance at all times. At the very least, recruitment teams should guarantee they undertake a full data audit and make themselves aware of their compliance obligations. </p><br /> <p>Honeypot is Europe’s developer job platform, active in Germany, the Netherland and the UK. Over 1,000 companies are hiring software developers, data scientists, QA and other tech positions on Honeypot. Emma is co-founder. </p>",

Is Germany setting a good example to the rest of Europe? Which countries have taken positive steps towards gender parity?

That’s a lower percentage than that of 15 other European nations including France, Norway and Sweden, but also Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria.  In actual fact, the percentage of women tech workers in Bulgaria is almost twice as high as in Germany. (30.28%)</p><p><img src='/assets/images/Percentage-of-Women-In-Tech-Graph.png' alt='Percentage of Women in Tech'></p><br /><p><strong>Ranked 14th in terms of average tech wages for women</strong>, practically on par with Slovenia at 44,292€ per annum, Germany has some way to go to compete effectively with other Western European countries.</p><p>Our data suggests that <strong>the German gender pay gap in tech is among the worst on the continent</strong>, with only Greece, Poland, Estonia, Slovakia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic ranking lower. To be precise, on average, male tech workers in Germany earn almost 15,000€ more per year than their female counterparts.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/Gender-Pay-Gap-in-Tech-Graph.png' alt='Gender Pay Gap in Tech'></p><br /><p>Further, it seems <strong>Germany’s struggles with gender parity in the tech field have deep roots</strong>. While a third of Italy’s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates are female, women in Germany account for little over 21.26% of all STEM grads.</p><p>While Germany’s troubles are worrying, it is still a very attractive country in terms of job opportunities, particularly given its unique composition between innovative startups and market-leading corporate.</p><p>Germany can look to other European countries, that have taken decisive steps towards gender parity.</p><br /><h2 id='eastern-european-countries-are-paving-the-way-for-change'>Eastern European countries are paving the way for change</h2><p>There’s been a lot of talk in tech-related media about Eastern Europe’s surprising new tech hub, and rightly so.</p><p>According to the <a target='_blank' href='https://digitalcityindex.eu'>European Digital City Index</a>, 13 Eastern European cities rank as having the best ecosystems for startups and an increasing number of Eastern European technology companies are establishing headquarters in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But while Eastern European tech companies were already known for being innovative and highly ambitious, few would have guessed they’d be among the most women-friendly tech businesses across the continent. Nonetheless, our data suggests <strong>Eastern European countries offer some of the best opportunities for women in tech.</strong></p><p><strong>Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania and Latvia make up the 4 countries with the highest percentage of female tech workers in Europe</strong> (ranging from 24.87% in Latvia to 30.28% in Bulgaria) and 2 of the 6 highest ranked countries in terms of female STEM grads are located in the East.</p><p>More precisely though, if there’s one country in the bunch that stands out from the crowd, it’s Latvia. The Baltic state is only second to Sweden in the ranking of countries with the lowest gender pay gap in tech and is 1 of only 9 European countries to boast a smaller pay gap in tech than in all other industries. In other words, <strong>female tech workers in Latvia have fairer wages than women working in other industries in the country.</strong></p><p><img src='/assets/images/1Difference-Tech-and-Overall-Gender-Pay-Gap-Graph.png' alt='Difference Tech/Overall Gender Pay Gap Graph'></p><br /><h2 id='europe-must-continue-encouraging-gender-diversity-in-tech'>Europe must continue encouraging gender diversity in tech</h2><p>Our study shows that <strong>the proportion of female tech workers remains under 30% across the continent</strong>, which underlines how important it is that we inspire more women to seek out opportunities in tech. </p><p>Germany, especially, needs strong female and male technical leaders to encourage and grow opportunities for women in tech. There are a number of grassroots global organisations operating in Germany, such as WomenWhoCode, GeeksGirlsCarrots and WomenTechmakers, who are pushing for more opportunities for female developers and other engineering talent. We intend to continue to push for more equality too.</p><p>The report also shows that countries such as <strong>Latvia, Sweden and Finland are genuinely making strides towards parity both in the tech industry and in general</strong>, and we can only hope that their example will serve as a catalyst for Germany and the remaining European nations to address their wage disparities.</p>",

Make sure people are interested in the topic</h2><p><em>Validate the topic before you think about organizing a conference</em></p><p>Before launching GraphQL Europe, we planned a series of meetups. In Berlin alone, there were over 100 people consistently in attendance. We could see that GraphQL meetups in other cities were reaching similar numbers. We also set up a GraphQL dedicated Slack channel, which grew rapidly. From here,  we went on to setup a landing page with an email subscriber list.

Have all the skills you need on your core team</h2><p><em>Bring more than just developers onto your team</em></p><p>Non-profit conferences require a dedicated core team. Most of the work is done after normal hours. The GraphQL team had two developers, two business people and a designer. This was the perfect mix of skills to push the event forward and for the team to be pretty self-contained.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/artyom-chelbayev.jpg' alt='Artyom Chelbayev, one of the GraphQL Europe team wearing our team shirts!'><em>Artyom Chelbayev, one of the GraphQL Europe team wearing our team shirts!</em></p><p><img src='/assets/images/graphql-audience.jpg' alt='The audience enjoying a speaker at GraphQL 2017'><em>The audience enjoying a speaker at GraphQL 2017.</em></p><br /><h2 id='3-divide-and-conquer'>3.

We used Trello to coordinate tasks, Google Drive to share resources and InVision and GitHub for website and design assets.  </p><p>Divide the responsibilities amongst your core team and make sure those people have full ownership. We created an email address for each area and everyone on the core team received the emails, that way we had clear transparency and also accountability.  </p><ul><li><strong>Logistics:</strong> this person covers venue, food, A/V setup and various things like this. Usually, they have a large amount of work to do at the start, particularly with visiting venues.  </li><li><strong>Sponsors and Finance:</strong> this person will do outreach to potential sponsors and partners and will also make sure they are looked after during the conference. </li><li><strong>Speakers and Content:</strong> this person will do the outreach to speakers, manage the CFP and application and selection process. On the day, they will be the point of contact for the speakers, shuffling them to the stage when their time to speak comes. </li><li><strong>Tech and Design:</strong> Usually two people, who work closely together.

Make sure the ticket price covers the cost of the venue and food</h2><p><em>Let the venue guide ticket price</em></p><p>GraphQL was established as a non-profit conference, so our main motive was to make it as accessible to people as possible. As a word of warning - organizing a developer conference can be a big financial risk. Be sure that you plan your budget very well to avoid incurring significant losses yourself. </p><p>The cost of the venue will dictate the price you can charge for the tickets. You want to guarantee that the ticket price will cover at least the cost of the venue.  Each successive sponsor allowed us to plan for more exciting things, with perks such as a party and swag bags being planned very last minute. We planned for a conservative, base and optimistic case. In all cases, the price of the tickets would allow us to break even.</p><p>We also made sure food was included in the price of the hotel so that we could pay it all in one lump sum payment. Include lots of vegan options and have plenty of drinks available, so people can stay alert and concentrated. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/conference-food.jpg' alt='Food options at the venue'></p><br /><h2 id='6-find-at-least-two-speakers-before-you-launch-the-event'>6. Find at least two speakers before you launch the event</h2><p><em>Give credibility to your conference by anchoring it in great content from day one</em></p><p>On our core team we had Oleg Ilyenko, creator of Sangria, and Johannes Schickling, Co-Founder of Graph.Cool, both of whom have built strong relationships within the community. This allowed us to connect with great keynote speakers, including Lee Byron and Dan Schafer, co-creators of GraphQL.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/lee-byron.jpg' alt='Lee Byron giving the closing keynote speech at GraphQL-Europe 2017'><em>Lee Byron giving the closing keynote speech at GraphQL-Europe 2017.</em></p><br /><h2 id='7-take-diversity-seriously-from-the-start'>7. Take diversity seriously from the start</h2><p><em>Plan serious time investment for direct outreach initiatives</em></p><p>The Travis Foundation, through their <a target='_blank' href='https://foundation.travis-ci.org/projects/diversity-tickets'>Diversity Tickets</a> program, supports conferences and events by helping them to offer diversity tickets to underrepresented minorities in tech. Through a <a target='_blank' href='https://diversitytickets.org/events'>dedicated website</a>, minorities in tech could apply for <a target='_blank' href='https://diversitytickets.org/events/65'>tickets for GraphQL-Europe 2017</a>. GitHub covered the full cost of the diversity tickets which we offered to attendees for free.  </p><p>Despite our blind Call for Papers (CfP) in our application process and our Travis Partnership, we were disappointed with minority representation at GraphQL-Europe 2017. Our learning? You need to set time to do direct outreach to invite minorities to come and speak at the conference - and offer support in developing the content, particularly for first time speakers. In the end we had 9% female attendance at the conference. We hope to increase that significantly over the next few years.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/alison-johnston.jpg' alt='Alison Johnston delivering her speech “Mock Q buddy: Easy API Driven Design and Accurate Documentation with GraphQL”'><em>Alison Johnston delivering her speech “Mock Q buddy: Easy API Driven Design and Accurate Documentation with GraphQL”.</em></p><br /><h2 id='8-use-a-blind-cfp'>8. Use a blind CfP</h2><p><em>And do a speaker pre-selection</em></p><p>Before we launched the official CfP, we did a speaker preselection to fix our keynote speakers early. In our case, we managed to get Lee Byron (GraphQL Co-creator from Facebook) and Sashko Stubailo (Open Source Lead at Apollo) to hold our keynotes.</p><p>For the CfP process, we used <a target='_blank' href='http://www.papercall.io'>PaperCall</a> to manage all talk submissions, which has an optional &quot;anonymous&quot; submission process and back and forth feedback with potential speakers.  </p><p>The actual CfP was launched six months before the conference. We constantly promoted the CfP on all available social media channels, as well as at local Meetups and developer conferences. Furthermore, we reached out to thought leaders and experts encouraging them to submit talks.</p><p><img src='/assets/images/tasveer-singh.jpg' alt='Tasveer-Singh speaking at GraphQL 2017'><em>Tasveer-Singh speaking at GraphQL 2017.</em></p><br /><h2 id='9-form-a-selection-committee'>9. Form a selection committee</h2><p><em>Be systematic in your speaker selection</em></p><p>Once the CfP was closed, we formed a selection committee of GraphQL experts. In total, we had 61 applicants through our CfP and we selected 14 speakers.</p><p> As we received a lot of proposals, we started by categorizing them into certain buckets (e.g. “GraphQL adoption”, “GraphQL tools”, ”GraphQL on Mobile”...). For the final selection, we simply picked the most appealing talk from each bucket to ensure a wide range of topics to be covered at the conference. While we were happy with the range of topics, we somewhat failed in creating a diverse speaker line-up, having only two single female speakers in the end. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/panel-discussion.jpg' alt='From left to right: Panelists Björn Rochel, Mina Smart, Daniel Schafer, and Brooks Swinnerton, with moderator Chad Fowler'><em>From left to right: Panelists Björn Rochel, Mina Smart, Daniel Schafer, and Brooks Swinnerton, with moderator Chad Fowler.</em></p><br /><h2 id='10-look-after-your-speakers-and-your-moderator'>10. Look after your speakers... and your moderator!</h2><p>Once all speakers have been selected and confirmed their attendance, it’s important to provide them with everything they need to know, including things like reimbursement, travel and accommodation, conference venue, logistics for the talk (slide format, audio available...). Also, don’t forget to send friendly rejection emails to all other submissions, encouraging them to resubmit next year again. </p><p>We had a travel budget of €1000 per speaker coming from outside of Europe and €500 per speaker coming from inside Europe. We also booked accommodation for all speakers in the same hotel. Many speakers had their company’s pay in exchange for free tickets. </p><p>A moderator sets the tone for the conference and we were lucky to have Chad Fowler join for the role. He did a great job of keeping the conference smoothly progressing. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/chad-fowler.jpg' alt='Chad Fowler, our moderator, introducing Dan Schafer, co-creator of GraphQL'><em>Chad Fowler, our moderator, introducing Dan Schafer, co-creator of GraphQL.</em></p><br /><h2 id='11-be-selective-about-your-sponsors'>11. Be selective about your sponsors</h2><p><em>Make sure they fit the conference</em></p><p>For sponsor outreach, we tried to target companies using GraphQL in production. Luckily GraphQL attracts a wide breadth of developers. </p><p>As we are a non-profit conference, we were able to be selective about our sponsors to make sure they fit our audience. In the end, we had nine sponsors in total. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/zalando-sponsor.jpg' alt='Zalando, one of GraphQL Europe’s sponsors'><em>Zalando, one of GraphQL Europe’s sponsors.</em></p><br /><h2 id='12-on-the-day-the-devil-is-in-the-detail'>12. On the day, the devil is in the detail</h2><p><em>Do a dry run of the logistics the day before the conference</em></p><p>The day before the conference, the whole team plus five volunteers met. We prepared the swag bags and assigned responsibilities. </p><p>We used the Eventbrite app for check-in, which is fast and efficient. At the start of the day we had 5 people on check-in, answering questions and giving out swag bags.</p><p>We organized a speakers&#39; room for the speakers to come, relax and practice their talks. There was food and drink there. We asked the speakers to be in the room 20 minutes before their talk, where a member of our team would come and collect them and bring them to get mic&#39;d up before going on stage.  </p><p>We assigned one person to look after accessibility and make sure the code of conduct was applied. We provided all guests with access to a phone number they could ring in case they needed accessibility help. </p><p>We also used the moderator to remind people of logistical details. </p><p><img src='/assets/images/graphql-checkin.jpg' alt='Conference check-in'></p><br /><h2 id='13-if-you-can-afford-to-have-a-party-have-one'>13. If you can afford to have a party, have one!</h2><p><em>Cheers to that...</em></p><p>At the very last minute, I mean the very last minute, we organized a party by putting €800 behind a local bar. Chad Fowler announced the party as the last message of the conference and a giant Honeypot brought the crowd there. The most important thing about the party was that it was in walking distance. </p><br /><h2 id='so-what-are-the-key-takeaways-when-organizing-a-developer-conference-of-your-own'>So, what are the key takeaways when organizing a developer conference of your own?</h2><ul><li>Be passionate about the topic - there will be blood, sweat and tears; and a lot of sleepless nights.

Vision: Candidate-Led Recruitment</strong><br /><font color='grey'>Central to every startup is the vision of the founders. Vision gives meaning to work. It lets us set our goals and is the foundation of our strategy. Everyone knows how difficult it is to hire developers and build great tech teams. But, to us, this is one part of the problem. Even more striking is the difficulties tech talents face in finding the perfect job - to find the right team, the right product, the right tech stack. Honeypot was born from the desire to solve this problem, always keeping in mind the candidate’s perspective.</font><br /><strong>2. Innovation: Strong Technical Foundation</strong><br /><font color='grey'>Our product is driven by simplicity - one central profile for great tech talents and a reverse recruitment model. The jury also recognized the strong technical foundation of Honeypot in our automated screening process and the AI we’re working on that powers the match between companies and talents.</font><br /><strong>3. Traction: Impressive Growth On All Fronts</strong><br /><font color='grey'>You might have a great vision and an innovative approach but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This is where Emma talked about our revenue growth, the number of sign ups from developers and the number of companies that are currently working with us.</font></p><br /><p>We couldn’t be prouder and it’s an absolute honor to be awarded first prize at such a prestigious event, pitted against such fierce competition! It really inspires us to keep believing in and working on our mission of getting every developer a great job.</p><p><em>PS: The trophy is now sitting pretty in our Berlin office - maybe we should invest in a shelf for it?</em></p><br />![Recruiting Startup of the Year Trophy](/assets/images/recruiting-startup-trophy.JPG)<br /><p>Thanks once again to Smart Recruiters for this awesome opportunity, we can&#39;t wait to see you next year!</p>",

Lower Cost-Per-Hire</strong></h3><p>A strong employer brand fosters a great work environment and makes your brand more attractive to potential candidates. This in turn means that your employees will be <strong>more inclined to refer your organization to other professionals</strong> and that you may have a <strong>ready-made talent community</strong> from which to draw from.</p><p>Look at it this way: if you&#39;ve worked on developing a strong brand image and job seekers are naturally attracted to your company, you&#39;ll most probably spend less money creating awareness for your job openings. Instead, you might just post your job opportunities across your company&#39;s social media channels.</p><p>And if you can count on your employees to convey a positive image of the company and refer you to job seekers, you&#39;re bound to spend way less on advertising and the such.</p><p>In actual fact, candidates generated through <strong>referrals are the 2nd cheapest means of sourcing</strong> and more and more job seekers admit they use social media platforms to gather information about employer brands and open positions.</p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/top-social-media.png' alt='What social media platforms do candidates use to gather information about employer brands?'><em>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://manpowergroup.com'>https://manpowergroup.com</a></em></p><br /><p><strong>Bottom line: According to Linkedin, companies that invest in employer branding experience a 50% cost-per-hire reduction.</strong></p><br /><h3 id='2-faster-time-to-hire'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Faster Time To Hire</h3><p>By investing in employer branding, you&#39;re able to attract more talent. And companies that can attract more talent can also <strong>hire that talent faster.</strong></p><p>One of the main benefits of having a strong employer brand is that you&#39;ll have a larger and better talent pool from which to fill vacancies. Basically, this means you&#39;ll be able to spend <strong>less time selling and more time closing candidates.</strong></p><p>Think about it from a sales perspective. It&#39;s a well known fact that inbound leads convert at a much higher rate than cold calls, right? Well it&#39;s the same for talent acquisition!</p><p><strong>Bottom line: Companies that invest in employer branding are up to 2 times faster when it comes to filling vacancies.</strong></p><br /><h3 id='3-lower-employee-turnover'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Lower Employee Turnover</h3><p>Alright so there are two ways this works.</p><p>On the one hand, having a strong employer brand allows you to <strong>attract qualified applicants.</strong> And usually speaking, you want to keep your best assets, meaning you won&#39;t be replacing them anytime soon.</p><p>And on the other hand, if you create a bond with prospective employees before and during the recruitment process (as well as the onboarding process), you&#39;re encouraging those future employees to have a <strong>high level of engagement</strong> with the company.</p><p>And as we all know, more engaged staff means increased productivity, higher company morale and <strong>lower employee turnover.</strong></p><p><strong>Bottom line: According to Linkedin, companies that invest in employer branding experience a 28% decrease in staff turnover.</strong></p><br /><h3 id='4-savings-on-salaries'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Savings on Salaries</h3><p>While it&#39;s certainly a very important factor, top talent candidates seek more than just an attractive salary.</p><p>Let&#39;s say that a positive employer brand encompasses 5 main qualities:</p><br /><ul><li>Job security.</li><li>More professional development opportunities.</li><li>Opportunity to work on a better team.</li><li>Organization with same values as candidate.</li><li>Organization that is talked about positively by present and past employees.</li></ul><br /><p>A company that manages to reunite all 5 qualities mentioned above is going to be able to offer candidates something more than just attractive wages.</p><p>In other words, investing in employer branding gives you a competitive advantage AND enables you to hire top talents <strong>without necessarily having to break the bank.</strong></p><p>Here are some interesting insights from the US to back up this argument:</p><br /><ul><li>Companies with all 5 of the qualities encompassing a positive employer brand can attract <strong>46%</strong> of full-time US workers without any pay increase.</li><li><strong>40%</strong> of passive candidates would be willing to move without a pay increase if an organization had most of the qualities of a positive employer brand.</li><li><strong>38%</strong> of younger professionals (18 to 34 years old) would be willing to accept a reduction in pay in order to work in a company with a positive employer brand.</li></ul><br />  <h2 id='help-attract-qualified-candidates'>Help attract qualified candidates</h2><br /><p>As significant as the financial benefits of employer branding may be, the underlying purpose of improving your organization&#39;s reputation as an employer is to be seen by more candidates and <strong>attract the top talent on the market.</strong> This in turn leads to increased productivity and reduced hiring costs of course, but it all starts with making your organization as attractive as possible to job seekers.</p><br /><h3 id='1-attract-passive-candidates'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Attract Passive Candidates</h3><p>Before we ask ourselves to what extent employer branding can help you to attract passive candidates, let&#39;s make sure we all agree on what a passive candidate actually is.</p><p>So basically, passive candidates are people who are already employed and who aren&#39;t currently looking for a job. They represent <strong>60% of the workforce</strong> and are generally more desirable for recruiters seeing as they&#39;re more likely to be motivated by a potential new role for the &#39;right&#39; reasons.</p><br /><p><strong>So how can employer branding help you to attract more passive candidates?</strong></p><br /><p>While offering a higher salary is generally the most effective way of attracting passive candidates, having a strong employer brand provides your organization with more selling points with which to pull them in.</p><p>Passive candidates could be just as tempted by a company that offers better <strong>growth opportunities or a healthier work/life balance</strong>, once again underlining the potential impact of investing in employer branding.</p><br /><p align='center'><img alt='What factors attract passive candidates?' src='/assets/images/passive-candidates.png' style='width:60% !important;'></p><br>*Source: http://www.middlemarketcenter.org*<br /><h3 id='2-visibility--trust'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Visibility = Trust</h3><p>Did you know that <strong>75% of job seekers consider an employer&#39;s brand before even applying for a job?</strong></p><p>In other words, no matter how interesting the role you&#39;re trying to fill may be, you&#39;ll never attract the right candidates if people struggle to find information on your company or if you have a poor online reputation.</p><p>In actual fact, the <strong>number 1 obstacle talents experience when searching for a job is not knowing what it&#39;s like to work at an organization.</strong></p><p>By investing in employer branding, making sure your website has a dedicated careers page, building a community on your social media platforms and encouraging your current employees to share their own experiences online, you&#39;re giving candidates the information they crave and making your brand significantly more attractive.</p><p>Candidates tend to trust a company&#39;s employees <strong>3 times more</strong> than the company to provide credible information on what it&#39;s like to work there, which is why it&#39;s so important to encourage high levels of staff engagement.</p><br /><h3 id='3-talent-retention'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Talent Retention</h3><p>It&#39;s important to keep in mind that a strong employer brand is good for attracting potential candidates, but also for retaining your best assets.</p><p>As previously explained, leveraging employer branding to create a bond with prospective employees before and during the recruitment and onboarding process can go a long way towards <strong>retaining key employees.</strong></p><br /><h2 id='improve-company-performance'>Improve company performance</h2><br /><p>In essence, the idea is that people who have a positive perception of your brand may be <strong>more likely to buy your products and services</strong>, and vice-versa.</p><p>Look no further than Apple for instance. We all remember the employee scandal that came out a few years ago and the negative impact that had on their business growth.</p><p>Having an employer brand that is focused on your people translates well to social media and other outlets where your customers interact, and the process of investing in employer branding builds a bridge between talent acquisition and driving revenue.</p><p>Not convinced? We&#39;ll let the statistics do the talking:</p><br /><ul><li><strong>71%</strong> of middle market companies with a clear and effective employer brand reported improved company performance in 2017, compared to 45% of firms with less developed employer brands.</li><li>Organizations with strong employer brands saw <strong>revenues grow by 20% and workforce grow by more than 12% in 2017.</strong></li><li>Firms with weaker employer brands experienced just <strong>under 8% growth in revenues and only 4.4% employment growth.</strong></li></ul><br /><h2 id='what-are-the-dangers-of-ignoring-employer-branding'>What are the dangers of ignoring employer branding?</h2><br /><p>If you ignore employer branding, you&#39;re basically refusing to acknowledge that your company&#39;s reputation is an important factor in a candidate&#39;s job search process.</p><p>You therefore risk losing top talents to your competitors, not being able to retain your best assets and spending far too much on recruitment.</p><p>As a matter of fact, <strong>50% of workers say they wouldn&#39;t work for a company with a bad reputation, even with a pay rise.</strong></p><p>Furthermore, employers who fail to invest in their reputation could be paying up to an additional <strong>$4,723 per employee hired</strong> (data related to American organizations) and the overall cost of a bad reputation for a company in Germany with 10,000 employees could be as much as <strong>€7.3 million in additional wages!</strong></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/cost-of-bad-reputation.png' alt='What are the costs of having a weak employer brand?'><em>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://business.linkedin.com'>https://business.linkedin.com</a></em></p><br /><p>Seeing how beneficial it can be in the long run, enhancing your company&#39;s reputation and actively encouraging employees to participate in your employer brand should be an absolute no-brainer.</p><p>And since <strong>68% of HR managers in 2018 say they&#39;re having difficulties hiring</strong>, up from 50 percent in 2013, it might be time for recruiters to improve their game and start investigating how to reach more quality candidates.</p><p>Embracing employer branding is a great place to start.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/ultimate-list-of-employer-brand-stats.pdf'>Linkedin&#39;s Ultimate List of Employer Brand Statistics</a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://www.hudsonrpo.com/portals/rpo/documents/Employer-Brand-Strategy-Guide.pdf'>Hudson: How to Launch a Successful Employer Brand</a><br /><a target='_blank' href='http://www.middlemarketcenter.org/Media/Documents/how-middle-market-firms-attract-and-retain-the-top-talent-that-fuels-their-success_NCMM_Talent_Research_Report_WEB.pdf'>NCMM: Building the Top Team</a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/employer-brand/2016/research-shows-exactly-how-much-having-a-bad-employer-brand-will-cost-you'>Linkedin: The Real Cost of a Poor Reputation</a></p>",

In other words, the following questions should allow recruiters to <strong>sort the thinkers from the doers</strong>.</p><br /><h2 id='1-what-is-the-ember-run-loop-and-why-is-it-useful'>1. What is the Ember run loop and why is it useful?</h2><br /><p><em>First things first, what is the Ember run loop?</em></p><p>So basically, pretty much all of the code you write in your Ember applications takes place in a run loop which is used to <strong>batch assorted actions and reorder them in the most efficient way possible.</strong>The run loop does so by scheduling actions, or jobs, on specific queues that are processed to completion in priority order.</p><p>Ember.js will create a run loop whenever a user interacts with the browser to execute any Javascript that needs to run in response. Once the run loop has looped over all of the actions on the queue in order of priority, control is returned to the browser.</p><p><em>Why is the Ember run loop so useful?</em></p><p>Batching similar actions allows for <strong>better pipelining, less rendering time and improved app performance</strong>. Moreover, the Ember run loop organizes the execution of code in logical blocks, meaning it’s much easier to maintain. </p><br /><h2 id='2-what-is-ember-data-and-how-does-it-work'>2. What is Ember Data and how does it work?</h2><br /><p><a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/emberjs/data'>Ember Data</a> is a library that helps you to manage model data in your Ember.js applications, define relationships between models and load records from the server that are instances of those models. What’s more, it saves your changes back to the server when the records are updated and also makes it easier to cache records for performance.</p><p>Confused? The core team behind Ember think of Ember Data as <strong>“a framework for managing models and relationships.”</strong> So yeah, if you don’t know what models are, we suggest that you keep reading! ;)</p><p>Knowing the different components of Ember data is key to understanding how it actually works, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s just say that Ember data is primarily <strong>a bridge between The Store (main interface / central repository of Ember data) and the server</strong>.</p><br /><h2 id='3-what-are-the-business-advantages-of-using-emberjs-instead-of-react-or-angularjs'>3. What are the business advantages of using Ember.js instead of React or AngularJS?</h2><br /><p>We’ll get into the technical advantages of using Ember at a later stage, but for now let’s ask ourselves to what extent EmberJS is beneficial for product owners and business stability.</p><p>Choosing the right development solution, or in our case the right JavaScript framework, is not a decision to be taken lightly. <em>Why?</em> Because choosing the wrong solution for your needs could mean having to make another change in the near future which in turn could lead to <strong>avoidable costs, slower development and lost customers.</strong></p><p>For that reason, it’s very important that businesses and product owners consider each solution’s level of dependability and durability when selecting the right framework.</p><p>One of the main advantages of using Ember.js is that they introduced a <strong>Long-Term Support</strong> (LTS) release channel of their product back in 2016 (<a target='_blank' href='https://angularjs.org/'>Angular</a> released it on their 4.0 version in May 2017 while <a target='_blank' href='https://reactjs.org/'>React</a> decided that moving from two-week releases to monthly releases was sufficient for now). Long-term support extends the period of software maintenance and reduces the frequency of software updates, meaning lower development costs and less risk for businesses.</p><p>Furthermore, Ember.js follows the same <strong>coding by convention</strong> principle as <a target='_blank' href='https://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a>, a software design paradigm that aims to decrease the number of decisions a developer using the framework has to make without losing flexibility. In other words, new development team members don’t have to learn as many team-specific practices as they would with other JavaScript frameworks as the tool pretty much forces developers to use its rules anyway.</p><p>And finally, <strong>EmberJS is going strong!</strong> Plenty of big names are regularly using and improving the framework, including Linkedin, Twitch and Apple, so it’s fair to presume that EmberJS won’t be going obsolete anytime soon!</p><br /><h2 id='4-what-are-controllers-used-for-in-emberjs'>4. What are Controllers used for in Ember.js?</h2><br /><p>A controller is basically <strong>a file that is used to manipulate data before passing it down to views</strong>. A controller is usually paired with an individual route and is what responds to user interactions happening on the user interface.</p><p>The manner in which you create controllers depends which files you want to be able to communicate with each other, how <a target='_blank' href='http://deviq.com/don-t-repeat-yourself/'>DRY</a> (“Don’t repeat yourself” ) you want your code to be and how you will save state, but it’s generally good practice to create a controller when:</p><ul><li>You want to share actions or variables with child components.</li><li>You have a computed property that’s determined by the results of the model hook.</li></ul><p>That being said, you don’t necessarily need to use a controller, especially when your data is self sufficient and you don’t need to add any additional logic. </p><br /><h2 id='5-do-router-and-route-mean-the-same-thing-in-emberjs-if-not-what-makes-them-different'>5. Do Router and Route mean the same thing in Ember.js? If not, what makes them different?</h2><br /><p>As you can imagine, route and router are very closely linked but don’t carry the same meaning.</p><p>While <strong>routes are responsible for setting up application state, displaying templates and loading data, a router matches the current URL to the different routes you’ve defined.</strong></p><p>When a new URL is set (the user loads the app for the first time, changes the URL manually or clicks on a link within the app), the Ember router then maps that new URL to one or more route handlers that are in turn capable of either rendering a template, loading a model that is then available to the template or redirecting to a new route.</p><p>In other words, routes are responsible for defining the data that is sent to the template, but they wouldn&#39;t function without a router.</p><br /><h2 id='6-what-are-the-main-technical-advantages-of-using-emberjs'>6. What are the main technical advantages of using Ember.js?</h2><br /><p>So we previously discussed why Ember.js is such an interesting JavaScript framework from a business standpoint, but what makes it so appealing to developers? What are the technical advantages of Ember.js when compared to other frameworks?</p><p>Ember’s motto, <em>“Convention over configuration”</em>, pretty much answers this question. Developers who work with Ember generally spend more time shipping code and less time setting up development environments and well, yak shaving. <em>Why?</em> Because whenever you generate a resource, model or component in Ember, <a target='_blank' href='https://ember-cli.com/'>ember-cli</a> (Ember’s command line utility) sets up all the tests for you.</p><p>There are no third party libraries (Mocha, Jasmine or Karma for example) or build tools (such as Grunt or Gulp) in Ember, meaning <strong>developers don’t have to worry as much about configurations and testing environments.</strong></p><p>Moreover, Ember comes with its <strong>own client side mock server in the form of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/'>ember-cli-mirage</a></strong>. The same can be said for several other JavaScript frameworks, but they’re much harder to set up.</p><p>And last but not least, Ember has <strong>adopted the latest Javascript and web standards</strong>, including promises, web components and ES6 syntax, and has been widely praised by developers for showing a long-standing commitment towards <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><br /><h2 id='7-how-is-data-communicated-between-your-server-and-your-ember-application'>7. How is data communicated between your server and your Ember application?</h2><br /><p>To answer the question without getting overly-technical, data is basically communicated between your server and your Ember application thanks to what we call <strong>Adapters</strong> and <strong>Serializers</strong>.</p><p>While <strong>adapters tell us which URL to use</strong> (the place that you’re going to be sending this request), <strong>serializers make sure the data is in the right format</strong>.</p><p>In actual fact, a serializer determines the data you send and the data you get back, so it takes what’s in your ember data model and turns that into something that you can send to the server, and then normalizes the data that you get back from the server.</p><p>Serializers therefore communicate with models in order to ensure data is consistently structured and relationships between data are mapped. (We’ll talk more about models in the next question).</p><br /><h2 id='8-templates-models-and-components-are-key-concepts-in-ember-describe-them'>8. Templates, Models and Components are key concepts in Ember. Describe them.</h2><br /><p>Mastering Ember.js without understanding templates, models and components is like <a target='_blank' href='http://www.haveyoueverseentottenhamwintheleague.com/'>Tottenham winning the Premier League</a>. While we appreciate your wishful thinking and optimism, it just ain’t gonna happen!</p><p><em>Now we’ve got that out of the way, here’s a brief overview of each concept.</em></p><br /><h3 id='templates'>Templates</h3><p>This one’s quite self-explanatory. As you’d expect, Ember uses templates to <strong>organise the layout of HTML</strong> in an application. Ember templates use the syntax of Handlebars templates and can display properties provided to them by a component or a route’s controller.</p><br /><h3 id='models'>Models</h3><p><strong>Models represent persistent state</strong>.</p><p>For example, an online auction platform would want to save the details of an item when a user publishes it, and so an item would have a model defining its details, perhaps called the item model.</p><p>While a model usually persists information to a web server, models can also be configured to save elsewhere, such as the browser’s Local Storage for instance.</p><br /><h3 id='components'>Components</h3><p>Look at it this way. Templates describe what a user interface looks like while <strong>components control how the user interface behaves</strong>.</p><p>Components are usually made up of two parts. You’ve got a template written in Handlebars (as previously mentioned) and a source file written in JavaScript that defines the behaviour of the component.</p><p>If we go back to our online auction example for instance, the platform might have a component for displaying all items that can be found on the website called all-items, and another component for displaying an individual item called item-specific. </p><p>In this case, the item-specific component might define a behaviour that lets the user hide and show the image property of the item for example!</p><br /><p><strong>So there we are!</strong></p><p>We hope these questions helped broaden your understanding of Ember.js and provided you with some useful tips on how to prepare for your next Ember.js interview!</p><p><em>This article is the beginning of an extensive series dedicated to front-end developer interview questions (and more), so be sure to come back soon for more interesting insights!</em></p>",

So much so that <strong>GDPRday is currently trending on Twitter</strong> and a Google search of “GDPR” brings up over 118 million results. That’s almost 4 times as many searches as TV show “Westworld” but still 2 times less than “cute cats”. <em>Any more random insights, anyone?</em></p><p>All joking aside, the <strong>GDPR is set to revolutionize the way companies process personal data and empower EU citizens to take back control</strong>, and we for one believe it was about time. So, without further ado, let’s get stuck in.</p><br /><h2 id='whats-this-whole-gdpr-thing-about'>What’s this whole GDPR thing about?</h2><br /><p>GDPR stands for <strong><a target='_blank' href='https://gdpr-info.eu/'>General Data Protection Regulation</a></strong>. Sounds particularly dull, doesn’t it? But see, it’s actually quite interesting if you look beyond the legal jargon and latch on to what it really means. </p><p>In a nutshell, GDPR is a regulation in EU law on <strong>data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area</strong>. It basically aims to give control back to citizens over their personal data and harmonize data protection law across the European market.</p><p>The GDPR replaces the <strong><a target='_blank' href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML'>1995 EU Data Protection Directive</a></strong> and takes effect today.</p><br /><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>Lot of films aren’t GDPR compliant, actually. <a target='_blank' href='https://t.co/sXkynSBWRy'>pic.twitter.com/sXkynSBWRy</a></p>&mdash; Ian B (@TheAdmiral) <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/TheAdmiral/status/998666920323887104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>May 21, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script><br /><h2 id='what-are-companies-and-consumers-saying-about-gdpr'>What are companies and consumers saying about GDPR?</h2><br /><p>While it’s difficult to estimate what percentage of companies agree with GDPR, it’s fair to imagine that the majority of organizations recognize the need for this new regulation and actually support it.After all, GDPR isn’t necessarily bad for business, au contraire!</p><p>Wait what, <em>how is GDPR actually good news for companies based in the EU?</em></p><ul><li><strong>Harmonized data protections laws</strong> across the whole continent mean that all companies operating in Europe will abide by the same rules, regulations and conditions regarding data protection. (This was NOT the case before GDPR!).</li><li>In theory, GDPR-compliant companies will generate a <strong>higher level of trust</strong> and therefore gain an advantage over competitors who don’t comply.</li><li>GDPR focuses on <strong>first-party data</strong>, i.e data of the highest quality that comes directly from customers. In other words, GDPR-compliant companies will have access to better data, and in principle, better leads.</li></ul><p>And seeing as the arrival of GDPR will put the control of personal data back into the hands of the individual, <strong>consumers have mostly welcomed this change</strong>.</p><br /><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>Happy <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>#GDPR</a> day!

While employee branding and company culture dominated as HR trends this year, in 2019, many are shifting their eyes towards the <strong>development of analytics and predictive technologies within people management.</strong></p><br /><h2 id='so-what-are-hr-analytics-and-why-should-you-care'>So what are HR Analytics and why should you care?</h2><br /><p>HR analytics provides insights for organizations to efficiently hire and manage employees so that business goals can be quickly reached. According to Jan Werth, a Senior IT Recruiter at MYTOYS Group, <em>“HR analytics will be a huge help for recruiters in terms of automating certain aspects of the talent search process.”</em>&#39; By using employee data to make decisions, HR teams can improve ways they attract, manage, and retain talent, which can help create a better work environment, maximize employee productivity and increase your return on investment.</p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/jan-hive.jpg' alt='Jan Werth at Hive'><em>Jan Werth at Hive</em></p><br /><h2 id='trends-paving-demand-for-hr-analytics'>Trends paving demand for HR Analytics</h2><br /><p><strong>HR technology has advanced since the traditional HR management solution days.</strong> Today, tools are often real-time cloud and mobile based with solutions integrated into employee hires, performance-tracking and wellness. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sierra-cedar.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/10/Sierra-Cedar_2016-2017_HRSystemsSurvey_WhitePaper.pdf'>Sierra-Cedar research</a> shows that <em>45% of large companies and 51% of mid-sized companies are increasing their spending on HR technology.</em> With that said, the proliferation of HR advancements are providing companies with more data towards employee engagements, ultimately gaining better understanding on how they can improve employee experience and productivity. After participating in our panel, Erika Enberg, the Director of People and Culture at Blacklane, adds, <em>“automation will continue in 2019, and eventually robots and chatbots can help us manage and measure employee experience.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/erika-hive1.jpg' alt='Erika Enberg at Hive'><em>Erika Enberg and the rest of the &quot;When engineers become managers&quot; panel</em></p><br /><p><strong>Quality and quantity of workforce data is on the rise.</strong> Organizations today have more access to accurate, reliable, and integrated data than previous years. This makes it much easier for HR teams to leverage their analytics and dive deeper into operational challenges that can improve the organization’s performance. Through this predictive form of analytics, Daša Rupar, the Senior HR Analytics Manager at AUTO1, emphasizes that companies should not only <em>“count the numbers but also use them to support long-term business decisions.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/dasa-hive.jpg' alt='Daša Rupar at Hive'><em>Daša Rupar at Hive</em></p><br /><p><strong>Hiring well is becoming more competitive.</strong> Teams are constantly searching for the best talent; throughout this process, HR analytics can address this challenge by using data to plan and identify the future needs of an organization in terms of number of hires, types of positions, skills and experience needed. A data-driven approach also provides access to a pool of filtered candidates so organizations can predict where they need to be in the next few years.</p><br /><h2 id='challenges--benefits-of-hr-analytics'>Challenges &amp; Benefits of HR Analytics</h2><br /><p>The path to actionable HR analytics is not always easy. There are many hurdles that teams need to surpass in order to benefit from the rewards. Challenges can include finding people with the right skill sets to manage the data, lack of real time performance analysis, delayed feedback, data validity, poorly defined metrics or even finding the right HR technologies to manage the data.</p><p>Despite the given obstacles, the benefits that come with HR analytics can outweigh the hurdles. After his talk, Mark Levy, Airbnb&#39;s former Employee Experience Pioneer, shared, <em>“these data can help us understand the nuances and needs of different employees, so that we can help people be their best self both outside and inside of work.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/mark-hive.png' alt='Mark Levy at Hive'><em>A quote taken from Mark Levy&#39;s talk at Hive</em></p><br /><p>Making decisions based on past data can lead to better hires, improved productivity, informed predictions and optimal return on investment. In sum, <strong>HR analytics could not only help from an operational perspective but could also serve as a strategic way for companies to reach business objectives.</strong></p><br /><h2 id='so-whats-the-future-of-hr-analytics'>So what&#39;s the future of HR Analytics?</h2><br /><p>In short, systems are changing just as much as we are. People are not looking for jobs the same way they did ten years ago; with that said, it’s vital that companies update how they recruit and manage talent. Jeri Doris, Chief People Officer at Delivery Hero, concludes that <em>“employee experience will continue to be a key factor, but data will determine what shapes predictions on understanding trends in a people-perspective and how we improve the work experience.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/jeri-hive.png' alt='Jeri Doris at Hive'><em>A quote taken from Jeri Doris&#39; talk at Hive</em></p><br /><p>Ultimately, as we move forward, more and more teams will integrate HR analytics across various organizational functions in order to define the most efficient ways to achieve future business success.</p><br /><p>PS: Sorry you missed #HiveConf18?

      "contents": "<p>While it may get less attention than the capital city Amsterdam, Rotterdam shows promising potential to be the next innovative and technology hub of the Netherlands. Internationally known as the <em>“gateway to Europe”</em>, Rotterdam has grown considerably over the last few years and its tech scene is rapidly gaining traction and momentum - to the extent that it’s been given the nickname of <em>“Boston of the Netherlands”</em>.</p><p>The founders of local startups, including Helloprint, as well as coworking space <a target='_blank' href='https://www.42workspace.com/guide/tech-ecosystem-rotterdam-region/'>42workspace</a>, <strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wetechrotterdam.com/news/rotterdam-entrepreneurs-launch-wetech-rotterdam'>recently created the “WeTechRotterdam” initiative</a> to further develop the local ecosystem</strong> and organizations such as the Cambridge Innovation Center and the Erasmus Center for Entrepreneurship are <strong>empowering local entrepreneurial talents to turn their ideas into actual businesses.</strong></p><p>Rotterdam is an increasingly attractive destination for Dutch and foreign developers (and other tech professionals) alike, so we sat down with a range of managers, recruiters and CTOs to <strong>get a better understanding of the local tech market and determine what makes Rotterdam such an interesting option for developers.</strong></p><br /><h2 id='high-demand-for-tech-workers-in-rotterdam'>High demand for tech workers in Rotterdam</h2><br /><p>Rotterdam is becoming an increasingly popular destination for working expats and native Dutch alike. From 2007 to 2017, the <strong>population of Rotterdam grew from 584,058 to 634,660</strong>, a growth rate approaching nearly 10%. Yet despite this increase, Rotterdam (as well as other major cities in the Netherlands) is actually suffering from a huge tech talent shortage. In actual fact, the <strong>demand for junior tech talent in the Netherlands doubled in 2017</strong> and it’s believed that there are approximately <a target='_blank' href='https://www.amsterdameconomicboard.com/app/uploads/2017/09/Fighting-the-odds.pdf'><strong>26 job openings per available junior tech worker.</strong></a></p><p>Consequently, in an effort to fill the gap between the supply and demand for tech talents, companies are increasingly relying on new local grads and expat tech workers. Giuseppe Maggiore, the CTO of Hoppinger, has definitely observed this phenomenon. He says <em>“There is a huge amount of expats in Rotterdam, and companies are switching more and more towards non-Dutch speaking developers.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/26vacancies.png' alt='Dutch tech employment statistic'></p><br /><p>But that’s not to say Dutch developers aren’t in demand. Far from it. Erik van Aalzum of Jedlix chimes in <em>“We see that more companies are looking towards changing to English as the main language <strong>as a result of the shortage of Dutch developers in the market…</strong> It is easy, cheap, and accessible to relocate to Rotterdam.”</em></p><p>And seeing as Martijn van Citteren of Coolblue believes that <em>“after an extensive selection process in which the last step is a visit to our office and a tour of Rotterdam, it is easy to convince an international candidate that Rotterdam is a great city to work and live as Rotterdam sells itself”</em>, you can understand why more and <strong>more companies have switched their focus to expat workers</strong> in the face of this local talent shortage.</p><br /><h2 id='access-to-top-tech-talent-in-rotterdam'>Access to top tech talent in Rotterdam</h2><br /><p>As you’ve most probably understood by now, there’s a <strong>shortage of available tech talent in Rotterdam</strong>. This means that the few available candidates on the market are very hot property and <strong>startups struggle to compete</strong> with the big-spending, internationally recognized corporates and larger companies they’re up against.</p><p>Kartika Sidabutar, the Marketing Manager at YES!Delft, elaborates, <em>“Loads of startups here do not have a lot of money, so they are skeptical of paying recruitment bureaus and agencies. The <strong>biggest source [of employees] is from referrals and networks</strong>.”</em> Frits Klok of TiledMedia also agrees, <em>“It is difficult to find the right candidates for open positions. As a start-up it is more difficult to get exposure towards the right candidates, when going up against bigger consumer-facing companies with more extensive campaigns and brand identity. Companies that have significant amounts of money do not have any problems creating exposure.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/yesdelft.png' alt='YES!Delft'><em>YES!Delft - Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.wetechrotterdam.com'>www.wetechrotterdam.com</a></em></p><br /><p>Erik van Aalzum and Adriaan Mutter of Jedlix think there is access to international talent in Rotterdam, but lament the lack of local candidates. <em>“What I think is missing in Rotterdam is a technical university as they have in Delft or Eindhoven. <strong>There is no pipeline of young, high potential students in Rotterdam</strong>.”</em> But while that would provide Rotterdam with a larger pool of local tech talent, it wouldn’t necessarily stop bigger companies from being first in line and having their pick of the top talent. </p><p>Maaike Burgeat &amp; Vincent Grente, who respectively work in tech recruitment and as the COO of Lunatech Labs, are all too familiar with this dilemma. <em>“Lunatech is having difficulties at the moment. We’re in contact with schools to provide us with internships and part-time/summer work students, but <strong>many of these students are snatched away by bigger firms as soon as they graduate</strong>.”</em></p><p>Access to tech talent in Rotterdam is scarce, but in spite of these difficulties, Rotterdam-based companies continue to make substantial efforts to attract the developers they so desperately seek.</p><br /><h2 id='how-rotterdam-based-companies-are-trying-to-attract-more-developers'>How Rotterdam-based companies are trying to attract more developers</h2><br /><p>To help attract developers, companies in Rotterdam are increasingly looking to provide <strong>attractive working environments with nice perks and fun company culture</strong>. Martijn van Citteren of Coolblue states, <em>“Company culture has a very central role in our organization. From the moment Coolblue started, we have been nurturing several core values: open surroundings, flexibility, communication, and motivation through responsibilities and empowerment.”</em> Michael Heerkens, the CTO of Helloprint, chimes in, <em>“Culture for developers is significant nowadays. We offer freedom, responsibility, and empowerment while avoiding restrictions: <strong>work when you want as long as you achieve the desired results. Performance is key. Results are what counts</strong>.”</em></p><p>Lunatech are taking things even further by supporting the professional development of their tech workers through <strong>further training and education and offering extra incentives</strong> such as salary top-ups based on company performance as well as free tickets to attend local tech conferences and meetups.</p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/rotterdam22.jpg' alt='View of Rotterdam'><em>Rotterdam - Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.itinari.com'>www.itinari.com</a></em></p><br /><p>But as well as taking clear actions to become more attractive to potential talents, such as those mentioned above, companies are also trying to <strong>get closer to their ideal candidates in an attempt to catch their attention early on.</strong> Giuseppe from Hoppinger claims that <em>“if you have access to a school or university, you have an advantage”</em> and Tim from YipYip agrees that <em>“companies have to be more proactive and make better use of their networks”.</em></p><p>Overall it certainly appears as if offering extra incentives and focusing on sourcing students straight from campus are the two methods companies privilege when attempting to attract more developers.</p><br /><h2 id='opportunities-for-tech-workers-in-rotterdam'>Opportunities for tech workers in Rotterdam</h2><br /><p>While the high demand for tech workers and shortage of local talent in Rotterdam may cause companies all sorts of recruitment headaches, it’s obviously great news for locals or expats who are looking to find a tech job in the city.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://sterksen.com/en/'>Sterksen</a> claims that <strong>5 out of 6 tech job openings that are listed in the Randstad area are not filled.</strong> The <strong>demand for software developers and data scientists</strong> is particularly significant and average salaries for junior positions in these fields are starting at <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/ironhack/https-medium-com-alvaro-gonzalez-the-dutch-tech-dream-ab3a00625582'>€35,000, <strong>among the highest in all of Europe.</strong></a></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/juniorsalary.png' alt='Average Dutch junior salaries'></p><br /><p>And if great wages and a ton of open job offers to choose from wasn’t appealing enough for developers, it just so happens that Rotterdam specializes in various lesser-known economic sectors such as <strong>Clean Tech</strong>, <strong>Energy</strong> and <strong>Agro-Food</strong> and is home to some of the country’s most exciting startups including Dutch online retailers Coolblue, Europe’s fastest growing print platform Helloprint and medical AI startup Quantib.</p><p>As a side note, Jorrit Glastra, CTO at Quantib, claims <em>“there aren’t that many companies out there that are actually building a product with AI, most just provide AI solutions that help other businesses.”</em> The <strong>opportunity to work on cutting edge technology</strong> is what brings many tech professionals to Rotterdam and innovative companies such as Quantib are a big part of why Rotterdam is becoming such an important European tech hub.</p><p>What’s more, seeing as <strong>Rotterdam and The Hague joined forces in 2015 to form a new metropolitan area</strong>, nothing’s holding you back from living in Rotterdam and working in The Hague or vice-versa. This could be of particular interest to cyber security specialists due to the fact that The Hague has established itself as the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.thehaguesecuritydelta.com/images/HSD_Factsheet_International_DEF.pdf'><strong>largest safety and security cluster in Europe.</strong></a></p><br /><h2 id='community-initiatives-for-tech-workers-in-rotterdam'>Community initiatives for tech workers in Rotterdam</h2><br /><p>You don’t just have to just stick with your company in Rotterdam. There are plenty of <strong>opportunities for self-growth, networking, and learning</strong>, although the consensus among our interviewees is that there’s plenty of room for more. </p><p>Giuseppe from Hoppinger keeps busy, <em>“We host at least 1 Tech Talk each month and really focus on adding value and relevance. We get around 50-75 developers interested in attending and have to put some on waiting lists. I know some other organisations that try to host these events as well, but <strong>sometimes there isn’t enough traction</strong>.”</em> Frits Klok from TiledMedia is also positive about the future, <em>“There are more and more hubs popping up that were degraded, empty buildings and areas before. Areas such as Van Nelle Fabriek, “Goudse Straat,” and Industriegebouw now have hip hang out places for developers and tech enthusiasts. Meetings and meetups are held there, but we’d love to have more visitors!”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/pixelbar22.png' alt='Pixelbar.nl'><em>Pixelbar.nl - Source: @pixelbar010</em></p><br /><p>Maaike and Vincent from Lunatech Labs <strong>also regret the lack of attendees at local tech events</strong> and believe that <em>“by organizing events involving tech professionals from Rotterdam, The Hague and Delft, the local community scene could be even more prominent than that of Amsterdam.”</em></p><p>According to the <a target='_blank' href='https://2017.stateofeuropeantech.com/'>2017 State of European Tech report</a>, the <strong>Netherlands was ranked 5th behind the U.K., Germany, France, and Spain with 58,176 active members in tech meetup groups</strong>, over 50% more than 6th place Poland. There are also frequent TEDx Talks, designed to help communities, organizations, and individuals spark conversation and connection at the local level, as well as less mainstream initiatives including Pixelbar.nl, a so-called “hackerspace” founded by techies in Rotterdam and CoderDojo, a volunteer-led organization that teaches children to code.</p><br /><h2 id='what-does-the-future-hold-for-rotterdam'>What does the future hold for Rotterdam?</h2><br /><h3 id='dutch-innovation-hub'>Dutch innovation hub</h3><p>Erik van Aalzum of Jedlix explains that <em>“Amsterdam is the international hub in the Netherlands and Eindhoven has already been established as the ‘tech-area’ for a long time, but <strong>Rotterdam is becoming more innovation-minded</strong>.”</em> Tech and startup hubs are popping up everywhere, and the city and province are working together to put Rotterdam on the map and exploit all its strengths. Birgit Vene from Offcourse.io agrees that <em>“The municipality is really doing a lot of things, education wise as well, as they want to get more technically focused. If you are doing something together with the municipality, you are doing very well for yourself. *</em>Rotterdam wants to be <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bolidt.com/en/rotterdam-city-of-the-future'>the city of the future</a> with complete neighbourhoods of smart houses for example.”**</p><p>Organizations like <strong>WeTechRotterdam are trying to establish government-backed initiatives</strong> to improve the tech scene as well. As Fred Bartels from WeTechRotterdam explains, <em>“Tech companies in Rotterdam, be they established or brand-new, could really benefit from a shared platform via which to collaborate, match-make, and support one another. It’s all about sharing knowledge and effort in a joint campaign to promote Rotterdam as a leading tech hub in which to work and live.”</em></p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/wetechrotterdam.png' alt='WeTechRotterdam startup finder'><em>WeTechRotterdam Startup Finder - Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.wetechrotterdam.com'>www.wetechrotterdam.com</a></em></p><br /><h3 id='economic-development'>Economic development</h3><p>With all the ongoing hard work and development, it’s easy to get excited about the future of Rotterdam. We can get a sense of optimism and positivity for the future from everyone we interviewed for this project. </p><p>Lisette Braakenburg, the Senior Relationships Manager from the Cambridge Innovation Centre, tells us <em>“Rotterdam is definitely evolving as a city. You see it in the capital and investments. <strong>The municipality itself and foreign influences are getting involved in pretty much every level</strong>.”</em> Giuseppe from Hoppinger continues,  <em>“Rotterdam is a city of makers and doers. The perfect compliment to Rotterdam is to be the city of engineers and technology, where real stuff is made. In combination with the maritime and port industry, Rotterdam can make real waves. <strong>More and more competition is coming to Rotterdam, bringing substantial content and solutions to the city</strong>.”</em></p><p>Erik van Aalzum of Jedlix feels the same way, <em>“20 years ago, nobody wanted to come and live in Rotterdam because it was seen differently. Nowadays, due to the initiatives and the effort the city of Rotterdam has put in, Rotterdam is gaining momentum. Now students, expats, and nationals want to come to Rotterdam because of its personality, architecture, facilities, and events. There are loads of opportunities in the port and maritime industry. <strong>Due to a traditional lack of innovation and disruption in those industries, there are significant opportunities to innovate and improve the fields</strong>.”</em> </p><p>Fred Bartels of WeTechRotterdam also believes Rotterdam has a bright future and hopes to contribute to the city’s economic development. <em>“With the help of the municipality and city, <strong>Rotterdam can be significant in Europe.</strong> An initiative like WeTechRotterdam is not trying to compete with other organisations and initiatives, but rather trying to create an umbrella that helps connect the existing stakeholders and further develop Rotterdam’s ecosystem.”</em></p><br /><h3 id='attracting-entrepreneurs'>Attracting entrepreneurs</h3><p>Based on the growing demand for tech talent, initiatives and investments, <strong>Rotterdam holds a promising future and is becoming increasingly attractive for entrepreneurs</strong>. <a target='_blank' href='https://www.innovationquarter.nl/en/news/strong-growth-of-foreign-companies-in-west-holland/'>Innovation Quarter</a>, an organization aiming to enhance the economy and employment rates in West Holland, shares, </p><p><em>“In 2017, some 115 foreign companies opened an office or expanded their business in West Holland. <strong>These firms are expected to create in excess of 2,300 new jobs and to invest more than half a billion euros in the region.</strong> Since 2014, The Hague Business Agency, Rotterdam Partners and Innovation Quarter have been actively collaborating to place the region in the global spotlight and to attract and support foreign companies. This has paid off: <strong>over 30% of international companies that set up business in the Netherlands last year chose West Holland, compared to 20% in 2014.</strong>”</em></p><p>The continual growth of the region thus indicates the potential for startups to create buzz in Rotterdam. Although the city has been long established for its ports and often referred as the “Gateway to the World,” we can see how this nickname can soon apply to new tech ventures and innovation amongst the startup community.</p><p><strong>Much gratitude to everyone who so graciously spent their time to sit down with us and talk about Rotterdam.</strong> You can learn more about them and their companies below.</p><br /><p><strong>Birgit Vene (Business Developer) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.offcourse.io/'>Offcourse.io</a>:</strong> The open source platform for crowdsourced learning and knowledge sharing.<br><strong>Martijn van Citteren (Tech Recruiter) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.coolblue.nl/'>Coolblue</a>:</strong> One of the largest online shops in the Benelux.<br><strong>Erik van Aalzum (Chief of Product), Adriaan Mutter (IT Architect) - <a target='_blank' href='https://jedlix.com/en/'>Jedlix</a>:</strong> A smart charging application for electric vehicles.<br><strong>Fred Bartels (Program Manager) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.wetechrotterdam.com/'>WeTechRotterdam</a>:</strong> A non-profit initiative aiming to boost Rotterdam’s tech ecosystem.<br><strong>Jorrit Glastra (CTO) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.quantib.com/'>Quantib</a>:</strong> A Rotterdam based scale-up that provides machine learning radiology software.<br><strong>Giuseppe Maggiore (CTO) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hoppinger.com/'>Hoppinger</a>:</strong> A digital agency based in Rotterdam specialising in e-business portals, e-commerce solutions and complete digital transformations.<br><strong>Frits Klok - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tiledmedia.com/'>TiledMedia</a>:</strong> A global frontrunner in flexible, low-latency delivery of extremely high-resolution video content to consumer devices.<br><strong>Kartika Sidabutar (Marketing Manager) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.yesdelft.com/'>YES!Delft</a>:</strong> A tech incubator that helps entrepreneurs to build and grow leading technology companies.<br><strong>Lisette Braakenburg (Senior Relationships Manager) - <a target='_blank' href='https://cic.com/rotterdam/'>Cambridge Innovation Centre</a>:</strong> Acting as a gateway to Europe, CIC Rotterdam expands the existing community of entrepreneurs, investors and established businesses.<br><strong>Maaike Burgeat (Corporate Recruiter), Vincent Grente (Operations Director) - <a target='_blank' href='https://lunatech.com/'>Lunatech Labs</a>:</strong> A Rotterdam-based IT consulting, product research and development company founded in 1993.<br><strong>Martin Luxemburg (Director) - <a target='_blank' href='https://ece.nl/'>Erasmus Centre of Entrepreneurship</a>:</strong> The leading centre for entrepreneurship in Europe.<br><strong>Michael Heerkens (CTO) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.helloprint.nl/'>Helloprint</a>:</strong> Europe&#39;s fastest growing online print platform with activities in over 10 European countries.<br><strong>Tim Nooteboom (Creative Director &amp; Managing Partner) - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.yipyip.nl/app-ontwikkelaar-rotterdam/'>YipYip</a>:</strong> A mobile design and development studio based in Rotterdam.    </p>",

      "contents": "<p>Tech recruitment can be tough, for employers and developers alike. Employers often have to send hundreds of messages and get few responses, while developers have to read through dozens of generic messages. Here at Honeypot, we want to change tech recruitment, for the better, and make sure companies can easily connect with the best tech talents from around the globe. </p><p>But in order to be successful on the platform, it is crucial that the interview invites companies send pique the interest of the developers so both sides have a great user experience on Honeypot. Read on for the ultimate guide on how to make sure your Honeypot invites get accepted! </p><br /><h2 id='1-be-transparent'>1. Be Transparent!</h2><br /><p>We pride ourselves in providing the highest possible level of transparency. Talents indicate their salary expectations and provide links to their social media profiles. In return, we ask companies to be open as well. So, tell the talent about the job, your company, the team and projects and fill in all the fields in the form. </p><p>We understand that especially the salary range can be tricky since it depends on many different factors and is often only discussed at a later stage in the process. Nonetheless we highly encourage you to indicate a range at least to show the candidate you have taken note of their salary expectations and they have a ballpark idea of what to expect. After all, this is not a binding offer and can save you and the talent time by being clear about it upfront.</p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/recruitment0.jpg' alt='Recruit Proactively with Honeypot'></p><br /><h2 id='2-be-proactive'>2. Be proactive!</h2><br /><p>Talents on Honeypot don’t know which companies are on the platform and which vacancies they have. That means that unless you reach out to the candidates they will never know that you might be looking for someone with exactly their skills and knowledge. Don’t hesitate to reach out to talents even when they don’t match your requirements by 100% or you have questions on their CV. The talent has had many jobs in a relatively short period of time? Or indicates to speak advanced German and you don’t know if that is good enough? Simply send them an invite and discuss everything in a quick introductory call - always keep in mind that an interview invite is only a first point of contact with the talent and does not necessarily have to lead to a full-fledged onsite interview. </p><br /><h2 id='3-be-open-minded'>3. Be open-minded!</h2><br /><p>You increase your chances of finding great developers massively if you include the entire market and open up to English speaking talents. A large chunk of the candidates on Honeypot are from outside of the EU, they all passed our screening process and they include incredibly skilled and experienced engineers. Also, Honeypot takes care of the visa process so all you have to worry about is finding the right match for your team and the product you’re working on! </p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/recruitment1.png' alt='Discover talents to Honeypot'></p><br /><h2 id='4-be-fast'>4. Be Fast</h2><br /><p>Good developers don’t like to wait around and our talents appreciate a quick turnaround. Ideally the first contact should happen as soon as possible after the invite has been accepted, at least within two working days.  We encourage companies to complete the entire interview process within 2 weeks. The fastest Honeypot hire happened within 5 days! </p><br /><h2 id='5-be-precise'>5. Be precise!</h2><br /><p>Imagine your interview invite as a cover letter in which you want to convince the talent to work at your company. Be direct and to the point. Also, beware of typos and grammatical errors!</p><br /><h2 id='6-be-persuasive'>6. Be persuasive!</h2><br /><p>Software developers are in high demand. In your interview invite, you want to pique the talent’s interest - so make clear why you think you have a great opportunity for him or her! Your company profile is a great means for employer branding so make sure it’s always up-to-date and communicates who you are and what your culture is about (think of pictures of the hackathon or demo-day you recently organized in your office, your office pet or your awesome Space Invaders arcade machine). In your text, make sure you leverage whatever strengths you have - be it the tech stack, a super interesting niche product, a laid-back company atmosphere or very attractive salary. </p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/recruitment3.jpg' alt='Pesuasively Invite through Honeypot'></p><br /><h2 id='7-be-personal'>7. Be personal!</h2><br /><p>This is the most important tip of all.. Engineers are wanted. On other platforms they get approached all the time with impersonal, generic messages. Not on Honeypot. You want to stand out - make clear that you have read their profile carefully and show genuine interest! Tell someone why he or she stood out to you and why you feel he or she could be a great match but also mention why your company is an amazing place to work and what exciting product the developer would be working on. Don’t hesitate to be informal and direct! </p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/recruitment2.png' alt='Recruitment Invites Examples'></p><br /><p><strong>So what makes for a well rounded invite?</strong></p><br /><ol><li>Start off by telling the talent what piqued your interest and why you believe they’d fit into your team. Tell them about your company, your vision and mission and why you are an amazing place to work. </li><li>Then describe the concrete project they’d be working on and your tech stack.</li><li>How is your team set up? How do you work? </li><li>Mention any unique points you want to include and end with a quick outline of the interview process and a direct call for action.</li></ol><br /><p><strong>GOOD</strong></p><p><em>“Hi Jennifer, ​​I just came across your profile and I think you would be a great candidate for a new role at [Company].I saw that you have sound experience as a Team Lead and Java Developer and for us this looks very promising as we are currently looking for a team lead to for one newly founded team.The idea is to take some projects from existing teams and develop them further.

With <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tue.nl/en/tue-campus/news/20-03-2018-patents-remain-key-indicator-for-state-of-innovation/'>over 22.6 patents produced per 100,000 residents</a>, this innovative city is gaining attention from tech talents and international entrepreneurs. The growing startup community in Eindhoven is spearheaded by <a target='_blank' href='https://brainporteindhoven.com/'>Brainport Eindhoven</a>, a space created by the municipality to stimulate tech and design collaborations. </p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/eindhoven4.png' alt='Brainport Eindhoven'><em>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://innovationorigins.com'>https://innovationorigins.com</a> - Technology student ambassadors from India, Egypt, Brazil, Hungary and more visit Brainport Eindhoven for an extensive tour of high-tech companies the city.</em></p><br /><p>Various <strong>factors contribute to the city’s promising future such as influence from its academic institutions, the expat culture and its demand to hire tech talents.</strong> With this in mind, we’ve decided to explore Eindhoven’s startup scene and interview members from the community.</p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-university-influence'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: University Influence</h2><br /><p>We’ve all heard the college dropout stories from founders of many successful companies, but in this case, <strong>local institutions in Eindhoven are some of the main drivers of entrepreneurship.</strong> </p><p>Firstly, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hightechcampus.com/'>High Tech Campus</a> also dubbed as the <a target='_blank' href='https://uk.investinholland.com/eindhovens-sweet-spot-blending-technology-design/'>“smartest square kilometre in Europe,”</a> houses over 160 companies (eg. Philips, Shimano, NXP, and ASML) and over <strong>11,000 researchers, developers, and entrepreneurs from over 80 different global backgrounds. The space is meant to harbor daily collaborations to continue the city’s reputation of the latest technological inventions.</strong></p><p>According to Hans Aerts, the VP Software Development at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomtom.com/nl_nl/'>TomTom</a>, TomTom has moved its office to the High Tech Campus because of the high-tech atmosphere. He notes, “TomTom is working together with the University and Brainport to spearhead the future of autonomous driving.”</p><p>Secondly, the city is home to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tue.nl/en/'>Eindhoven University of Technology</a> which harbors various famous tech startups in the city, such as BitSensor, <a target='_blank' href='https://bitsensor.io/about-us/'>a cybersecurity startup awarded for its lineup of innovative efforts in Netherlands.</a>During our interview with Ruben van Vreeland, the CEO of BitSensor, he comments that Eindhoven was chosen as the company’s headquarter because his team consisted of former students of TU Eindhoven.</p><p>Likewise, Danny Peeters, the Lead Back-End Developer at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.studyportals.com/'>Studyportals</a>, supports Vreeland and adds, “we started in Eindhoven because our founders were students at TU Eindhoven. We stayed here because the municipality really cares about the tech and startup scene.”</p><br /> <p><img src='/assets/images/eindhoven2.jpeg' alt='TU Eindhoven'><em>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://thisiseindhoven.com'>https://thisiseindhoven.com</a> - TU Eindhoven consist of 7,300 students, 250 professors, 600 Ph.D. students, 200 postdoctoral researchers and 2047 employees. Source: Thissieindhoven.com</em></p><br /><p><strong>The university also plays a huge role in sourcing tech talents and hiring developers in Eindhoven.</strong> Jeroen Buskens, the General Manager at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.districs.nl/'>Districs</a> shares, “Even in a big company like ASML, recruiting can also be challenging...ties to the Technical University (TU) are useful in recruiting for developers and techies.” </p><p>Olivier Giraud, Marketing Manager at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.valid.nl/'>Valid</a>, additionally confirms that local universities heavily influence the Eindhoven tech scene. “We have close relationships with schools and institutions throughout the region, such as the TU Eindhoven, Hogeschool Fontys and Avans. In coming years this will not change, as the technical schools attract very competent and international talent.” </p><p><strong>Beyond talents sourced from the university, the student community has clearly achieved admirable feats.</strong> For example, “<a target='_blank' href='https://e52.nl/en/solar-team-eindhoven-more-than-a-world-champion/'>Solar Team Eindhoven</a> became a World Champion at the World Solar Challenge three consecutive times; the team of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bluejayeindhoven.nl/'>Bluejay</a> is building a drone that can function indoors and assist in the healthcare sector. Another example includes the <a target='_blank' href='http://structural-ice.com/Projects.html'>Structural Ice Project</a>, which built <a target='_blank' href='http://ab-mediacommunication.com/2018/02/01/why-the-netherlands-is-the-new-silicon-valley-eindhoven/'>a 30-metre high ice tower in China and is planning to build an ice house on Mars.</a>” </p><p>In addition to technology and sciences, design is also another big focus in Eindhoven. The city is home to the world-renowned <a target='_blank' href='https://www.designacademy.nl/'>Design Academy</a>, who hosts one of the biggest design events in Northern Europe such as Dutch Design Week. This event promotes Eindhoven’s design community by displaying various projects and ideas of over 2,500 designers, with attendance of more than 295,000 people in the last event.</p><br /><p><img src='/assets/images/eindhoven3.jpg' alt='Eindhoven design community'><em>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://agne-k.com'>https://agne-k.com</a></em></p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-the-job-market'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: The Job Market</h2><br /><p>It’s an exciting time to be a part of the Dutch job market since the country’s economy has grown faster compared to the previous year, 3.2%. This growth was visible in almost all regions, especially Eindhoven. In 2018, it was not only Amsterdam (3.9% growth) that picked up, but also Eindhoven, with <a target='_blank' href='https://innovationorigins.com/eindhoven-shows-strongest-economic-growth/'>4.9% in economic growth.</a></p><p>Since 2014, <strong>unemployment in Eindhoven has also fallen dramatically.</strong> This drop resulted in an unemployment rate of 3.5% in 2018, with <a target='_blank' href='https://innovationorigins.com/period-economic-growth-continues-eindhoven/'>strong performance in high tech industries, manufacturing and commercial services creating high-quality jobs.</a> </p><p>Tech talents in Eindhoven will be a central focus of Brainport Eindhoven in the coming years. During our interview with Yvonne van Hest, the Program Director of Brainport Development, she shares,</p><p>“More companies within the region continue to have vacant positions due to shortage of personnel. Lack of tech talents in Eindhoven is expected to be a major challenge in the coming years. Brainport aims to tackle this shortage by investing in the technology and IT community through not only educational events but also by pushing initiatives to hire from the international community. Working together with local and international talents is vital for the growth of Eindhoven&#39;s tech community.”</p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-hiring-international-developers'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: Hiring International Developers</h2><br /><p>With Honeypot’s mission to match tech talents with great companies, we launched our beta product in Eindhoven a few months ago. Since then, we currently have tens of companies hiring on the platform, with hundreds of developers indicating interest in the city. </p><p>As mentioned, academic institutions have supplied many of the employers for local startups and companies. However, there&#39;s also an emphasis on the international aspects of the talent pool. A community member comments,</p><p>“Small and  medium-sized companies are  starting to shift towards non-Dutch candidates as well. Big companies such as ASML and Philips are the main catalysts for expats to come here, who welcome hundreds a month. After an X amount of time, they will start looking for other jobs. We want to make sure they do that in our region.” </p><p>Rutger Peters, the CEO of <a target='_blank' href='http://talent.gamehouse.com/'>Gamehouse</a> also shares with us that <strong>Eindhoven is appealing to developers and other international candidates because of the number of high-tech opportunities.</strong> He continues,</p><p>“Gamehouse pretty much only recruits across borders. There is not a big pool of suitable developers for Gamehouse, so we search for international talent. Eindhoven is attractive to expats because it is a city where you can build your life. As mentioned, Amsterdam is too expensive, busy, and too touristy. . There is a more relaxed work-life balance. Developers come here after having lived in Amsterdam for some time because it is more relaxed and in-depth.”</p><p>Danny Peeters, Lead BE Dev at Studyportals, also comments that “Studyportals has the advantage of being a very internationally minded company. We have 35+ nationalities at our office.” And Tim Drijvers, CTO of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sendcloud.nl/'>SendCloud</a> additionally adds, “there are  15+ nationalities in our team of 75. Daily work becomes more interesting when we have different backgrounds and perspectives.” The global tech hub has thus trickled into the diverse range of backgrounds found throughout the city.</p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-visa-process-for-tech-talents'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: Visa Process for Tech Talents</h2><br /><p>Locally, it’s clear that <strong>companies in Eindhoven are shifting towards a more global talent pool.</strong> Nationwide, the Netherlands also has a strong international global infrastructure and a newly released startup visa which encourages entrepreneurs and investors worldwide to make the Netherlands a viable “<a target='_blank' href='https://www.leapfunder.com/academy/reading_lists/10/articles/216'>EU-topia for entrepreneurship and foreign investment.</a>”</p><p>This visa process consists of a residence permit program that allows founders to launch their new business in the Netherlands within a year; beyond that, later-stage startups can rely on work permits for up to 5 years; and to further encourage international talents, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/taxation/dutch-tax-system'>expats have a 30% tax-free allowance on their gross salaries.</a></p><p>From a community perspective, Roy Schreurs from Expat Mortgages also adds that “It’s a very welcoming and familiar city for expats. As one-third of the city’s population is foreign, it’s very common to hear English spoken on the streets. Jeroen Buskens, General Manager at Districs, comments, </p><p>“There is a nice climate for developers here, especially international developers, quite coherent. Expats tend to get close to each other because it is a smaller city. Places such as Brainport XL, Stripe S, Seed Street make the tech hubs even more relevant.” </p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-startup-community'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: Startup Community</h2><br /><p>Other notable members of Eindhoven’s startup community include <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hightechxl.com/'>HightechXL</a>, an incubator program for high-tech hardware startups that helps young founders develop their business in a 3-6 month program in order to attract investors. </p><p>Secondly, Lumo Labs, located at Strip, an incubator that provides a two-year program for startups to be mentored by entrepreneurs in Eindhoven. Notable participants include <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pillowswillow.com/'>Pillow&#39;s Willow</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://vree.world/'>VRee</a>.</p><p>Thirdly, new on the TU Campus is Innovation Space, a space for professors, companies and students to work together on prototypes and the development of high tech products. </p><p>Last, but not least is the newly built High Tech Plaza, which will be the largest and most integrated startup hub in the Netherlands encompassing more than 10,000 m2, or about 108,000 square feet in three buildings on this giant research campus.</p><br /><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JvghPvT-iU' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><p>The new hotspot will consist of three buildings dedicated to house new ideas, scale-ups and a support center where investors, accountants and other business services will be located. There is additionally a large event space for future projects and startup community collaborations. </p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-international-investors'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: International Investors</h2><br /><p>With the city’s global buzz, Eindhoven marks a new target for foreign investors. As <a target='_blank' href='https://dispatcheseurope.com/hightech-connect-china-first-of-its-kind-investment-summit-matches-dutch-tech-capital-from-china/'>Dispatches</a> Europe reports, <strong>Eindhoven is on the radar for Chinese investors, who are arriving almost weekly from Shanghai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou, searching for the next opportunity.</strong> </p><p>According to Dispatches Europe, Dutch investors are conversely looking at expansion opportunities in China. “Huawei has about 600 employees in the Netherlands, 70 percent of whom are locals, according to Lang. The Dutch operations generated 368 million in revenue for 2017 and injected 37 million into the local economy in procurement. The company invested 80 billion in R&amp;D from 2000 to 2017 including about 14 billion last year.” </p><br /><h2 id='eindhoven-tech-scene-future-implications'>Eindhoven Tech Scene: Future Implications</h2><br /><p>Eindhoven is evolving into an international tech ecosystem, attracting eyes from all over the world. As we concluded our interviews, we asked how a few members in the community see the future climate of the Eindhoven tech community.</p><p>Bartosz Kuzmiciki, the CTO of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.withlocals.com/'>Withlocals</a>, answers, “The city is growing and has a great inflow of tech talents. Thanks to TU Eindhoven, international companies and scale-ups, people in the city are interested in knowledge sharing.”</p><p>Danny Peeters, the Lead BE Dev at Studyportals believes, “Eindhoven will continue to grow, especially its high-tech sector. Companies like AMSL and Philips will gradually expand within the region and show that corporates can work together with startups to create and innovate without limitations. Through this way of thinking, corporates in the city will remain relevant in the Eindhoven startup scene.” </p><p>As we wrapped up the interview, Ruben van Vreeland from BitSensor concludes,<strong>“Eindhoven is a great city that caters towards personal and professional growth.  If you want to be immersed in high tech innovation, Eindhoven is the Dutch city to be in.”</strong></p><p>In all, influence from top level institutions, new tech initiatives and the global component to the city has promoted a path for entrepreneurs to flourish in Eindhoven, so ears and eyes open for the next buzz coming from this city!

I have to manage myself well, even though I feel overwhelmed, I have to work to not get too emotional. This is something you live with. The advice I would give to young mothers? Please throw away ideas of a perfect mother. You will never be a perfect mother: you can have a career and a kid and it’s really fine. It’s fine if you eat out instead of cooking, it’s fine if you aren’t with your kid 24 hours a day; just enjoy the moments you do have with them and focus on quality time. It’s all about acceptance of your own limitations.</em></p><p><em>I am lucky I have help from my family, so twice a week I can study.

I think the switch to People Operations really reflects a positive change towards people in work.</em></p><p><em>I know this is the career for me; I love what I do. Not only am I helping people get a job, but more importantly I am impacting how much fun they have at that job. That&#39;s something I really get a lot of joy out of.&quot;</em></p><br /><h3 id='sarah-blech-customer-development-manager'>Sarah Blech, Customer Development Manager</h3><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Sarah Blech' src='/assets/images/sarah-b.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>*&quot;I’m very people oriented, so I thrive in this client facing position. I feel I can be an ambassador and put the word out about what we are doing. Inside Honeypot, I love to make people smile and feel good. I love to go to work. I have finally found a place where work is connected with friends, not only colleagues, where the well-being of everyone is central and people truly care for each other. I am so often astonished by the huge potential everyone brings to Honeypot.*</p><p><em>Sure there are also days when I have the feeling I am not mastering my tasks and they just keep piling up: I know this will also change with new tools we will implement, new processes we will agree on and the things we will learn while testing and trying. I like the challenge, the exchange of ideas, the support everyone offers and the freedom of seeing failure as learning.</em></p><p><em>Besides taking care of my clients I also reach out to potential clients. I do enjoy this sales side, too - client outreach, pitching and going to events, for example. But I don’t 100% see myself in a sales role in the future. I don’t believe sales is one of my true strengths and I want to focus on what I can do best. As I deeply care for people I want to be the social glue in a team that works close together. I see myself as a driver, mediator and connector. My strength lies in my drive for quality and detail.</em>&quot;</p><br /><h3 id='tabea-müller-head-of-data'>Tabea Müller, Head of Data</h3><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Tabea Müller' src='/assets/images/tabea-m.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>*&quot;It’s very hard to convince me to do something if I don’t think it’s logical. In high school, I always loved math. When I finished high school, math was the obvious choice for me. But going into studies, I realized how utterly different mathematics at university level is, compared to school. In school it’s more about calculations and analysis, in universities it’s more about proofs and linear algebra. After my Bachelor and my first experiences of work I felt like I finally knew what I wanted. I wanted to be closer to software development, well, close to business logic rather than hardcore coding.*</p><p><em>I joined Honeypot as a working student in Talent Management. I recently got promoted to Head of Data. I love to be part of our data team, because I think Data is so powerful. At first you may think it’s just a byproduct, but it’s so much more. You can discover patterns, support decisions, automate processes and understand behaviors and shape strategy.</em></p><p><em>I love that I am part of shaping the future of the company.  I translate our business processes into first models which our Data Scientists then turn into fully fledged algorithms. And of course I support the team with whatever is needed. It’s been really nice to see the data team grow and I love empowering skilled people. It&#39;s rewarding to watch ideas become reality.&quot;</em></p><br /><h3 id='laura-schukkink-country-lead-the-netherlands'>Laura Schukkink, Country Lead the Netherlands</h3><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Laura Schukkink' src='/assets/images/laura-s.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>*&quot;When I was a kid I dreamt of becoming a musical star. On Wednesdays and Fridays I attended a musical club where I danced, acted and sang. Although I loved it, it turned out my talent for singing wasn&#39;t my strongest suite. My colleagues can back that up after hearing me sing at our Christmas party. Looking back it was clear from a very young age that I wanted to work with people and end up in a position in which I could lead. During my bachelor studies I loved being in debate teams and also enjoyed taking the lead in group projects.*</p><p><em>A year ago I started out at Honeypot as a Customer Success Manager for the Dutch market. I have a background in hospitality and that proved to be useful for my new role. In a nutshell I was building relationships with clients and making sure they were finding the right candidates for their teams. After being in that position for half a year, Honeypot gave me the opportunity to develop my leadership skills as Country Lead for the Netherlands. It&#39;s great to feel that kind of support and have such an opportunity, and I&#39;m learning and developing every day.</em></p><p><em>Being responsible for both our client and developer-facing initiatives, as well as overseeing PR, marketing, HR and events for the Dutch market makes it a great and diverse role. Although the role is still new to me and I’m discovering and learning many new things, it is very rewarding, and challenging. Mistakes, falling down and getting back up again, it&#39;s all part of it. The biggest motivation for me currently is the steep learning curve and seeing the Amsterdam team grow and develop. I really enjoy leading, coaching and guiding the team the best way I can. Going forward I&#39;d like to leverage that to have an even bigger impact on business results.&quot;</em></p><br /><h3 id='debora-lasoen-head-of-talent-management'>Debora Lasoen, Head of Talent Management</h3><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Debora Lasoen' src='/assets/images/debbie-l.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>*&quot;Growth motivates me: my personal growth, growth of people, the growth of the organization. When I joined Honeypot, we were around 14 people. At the time, I had just finished a coding bootcamp and I joined as a Customer Success Manager. It wasn’t the role I applied for, I wanted to be in Talent Management and be in touch with the developers.*</p><p><em>As soon as the opportunity came, I joined the Talent Management team. First I became the Team Lead, then I became the Head. There is a big jump when your team grows to seven or eight people and you have to start delegating. We are the biggest team in the company. My job now is really about empowering people, giving guidance and clearing the path for them to flourish.</em></p><p><em>We really help people with a huge life decision, we know their hopes and wishes and we help them build a new life if they relocate. Those are scary things, so it’s nice to be there to personally support them. I remember I even invited one developer to join me and my friends at Berghain! The challenge for us as a team is to maintain the personal relationships we have with developers as we scale. I’m confident we can.&quot;</em></p><br /><h3 id='priscilla-tenggara-b2b-marketing-manager'>Priscilla Tenggara, B2B Marketing Manager</h3><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Priscilla Tenggara' src='/assets/images/priscilla-t.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>*&quot;I always thought I wanted the stability offered by big tech companies. I had previously interned at Facebook and loved it.  But when I received offers for full-time roles, I had a weird, sinking feeling that doors to unknown adventures were closing. In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted something a bit different.*</p><p><em>Right after graduation, instead of moving into big tech, I bought a one-way ticket to Berlin. I was always drawn to the excitement of living life with unpredictability but there&#39;s a side that anchors me to the comfortable choices like my parents, friends and just overall societal norms. In university, I was part of a business organization. My mentor, Ryan, was the person to give me the confidence to step out of my comfort zone. He’s one of the key figures in my life encouraging me to explore different paths. Having people like this who push you is really important.</em></p><p><em>When I joined Honeypot, I had zero experience working in startup environments. The adrenaline of ‘will I make it or will I not?’ is the type of rush motivating me to push forward. Working here has forced me to think outside the realms of small responsibility and to focus on the big picture. I get to work on all aspects of the marketing process from ideation, creation to execution - and I have a lot of responsibility. It&#39;s scary and requires self-focus and determination, but so far so good. And I’m learning a lot. I’m excited to see what’s next.&quot;</em></p><br /><p>As you can see, our women are driving the company forward, leading teams and shaping our future.

Together, the two companies will work towards Honeypot’s vision of creating the world’s largest worklife community for technical candidates while empowering developers and other technical candidates to find jobs they love.</p><p>It’s important to remember two key points:</p><br /><ul><li><strong>Honeypot will retain its candidate-driven ethos:</strong> Since inception, Honeypot has been candidate-driven in everything we do. We plan to maintain our focus and support of the developer and broader technical community.</li><li><strong>Honeypot will operate independently:</strong> While XING will have ownership of Honeypot, we will continue to operate independently, with our headquarters in Berlin.</li></ul><br /><p>Before diving into our future outlook, we want to take some time to reflect on the last four years of huge growth. </p><br /><h2 id='history'>History</h2><br /><p>We founded Honeypot in 2015. In our first months, we operated out of Kaya’s Prenzlauer Berg flat before moving close by to a small office on Schönhauser Allee. From the beginning, our perspective was candidate-driven: in a market where candidates are in such high demand, it made 100% sense to have them in focus. It’s been amazing to see how much that is appreciated by our users.</p><p>We grew Honeypot to profitability with less than €1.5 million of funding. We were cautious and lean in building the company because we knew the process of finding a job is very personal. We were focused on understanding the dynamics of how we could facilitate this, rather than pushing matches which were not right for either the candidate or the companies.</p><br /><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bw1Lb4M3QsM' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><p>Currently, we have over 100,000 technical candidates on the platform and nearly 2000 companies. At the beginning, we focused solely on developers, but by 2017 we realized that finding a perfect job as a developer very often meant finding the perfect team. With that in mind we began to slowly open the platform to the broader engineering team. Today, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Data Scientists, UX Designers, as well as CTOs, Engineering Managers and others are all successfully finding jobs on Honeypot. </p><br /><h2 id='community-ethos'>Community Ethos</h2><br /><p>Recruitment has a bad name among developers and other technical candidates. And it’s no surprise.  Aside from the known issue of spammy headhunters, inefficiency is rife: multiple interviews, unclear timelines, and intransparent feedback on technical assessments can make the job process long and tedious. One of the first realizations we had was we can’t be associated with headhunters, we need to be and remain as close as possible to the developer community.</p><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Florian, a former Talent Rep, and current Data Analyst, chatting with developers at GraphQL Conf 2018.' src='/assets/images/flo-graphql.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br>*Florian, a former Talent Rep, and current Data Analyst, chatting with developers at GraphQL Conf 2018.*<br /><p>And that proximity to the developer community is part of why we love what we do. Every developer on Honeypot has a personal Talent Rep to guide them through the process. Over the years, our Talent Reps have helped many hundreds of developers find new jobs. Hearing personal success stories of users has become a daily feature of our internal Slack channel. Some of our team have even gone to Berghain with a developer or two! </p><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Laura, Netherlands Country Lead, speaking at HR in Tech in the Netherlands.' src='/assets/images/hrintech-amsterdam.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br>*Laura, Netherlands Country Lead, speaking at HR in Tech in the Netherlands.*<br /><p>We host a bunch of meetups across Germany and the Netherlands for recruiters and technical candidates. We started <a target='_blank' href='https://www.graphqlconf.org/'>GraphQL Conf</a> in 2017 in collaboration with Prisma. What began as a small meetup in Berlin, quickly grew to a full-blown conference, with hundreds of guests and world-renowned speakers. For this year’s edition we are expecting 800 guests. We also run <a target='_blank' href='https://hive.honeypot.io/hive-conference-2018/'>HiveConf</a>, which brings People Ops, HR and Talent Acquisition together with Technical Hiring Managers, like CTOS, VPs of Engineering and Team Leads, to understand how to build and scale tech teams.

Not everything has been easy: our industry is driven by people and people have diverse motivation, which isn’t always easy to understand.  We don’t think the platform is perfect yet, but our ambitions are big and we do have a clear vision of where we want to go in the future:</p><br /><ul><li><strong>Open Europe to more international technical talent:</strong> We are firmly committed to growing European startups to compete globally: over the next three years we will enter 10 new markets. For European tech companies to compete globally, they need access to the best talent. For context, 70% of developers born in Silicon Valley are foreign born. That access to large pools of creative talent have made Silicon Valley what it is today. We want to make that happen here.</li><li><strong>Build a frictionless recruitment process driven by individual motivation:</strong> We believe in three core things to do with recruitment: 1.) sourcing should take just 30 minutes per week per recruiter 2.) candidates should only have to do one screening and this should work for all jobs 3.) motivation is the key to hiring and retaining great technical talent. Based on these beliefs, we are going to invest heavily in our technology to make recruitment as frictionless as possible.</li><li><strong>Build the world’s largest worklife community for technical talents:</strong> We believe that no platform is currently addressing the needs of technical candidates in building careers. We want to help candidates find jobs they love, but also lobby companies to develop open source programs, guide candidates in learning, development and mentorship, assist developers in finding freelance gigs and remote work, as well as with their relocation.</li></ul><br /><p align='center'><img alt='The team at HiveConf 2018.' src='/assets/images/team-hiveconf.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br>*The team at HiveConf 2018.*<br /><p>We want to take this opportunity to thank our users, our clients, XING, our angels, family and friends - but most of all our team.

      "contents": "<p>Finding an apartment, or even a shared flat, can be difficult in Berlin--especially if you are new in town. The good news is that Honeypot is here to help make your move as smooth as possible and to welcome you to Berlin with open arms! </p><p>In this post, you’ll find 15 tips to assist you in your search for the perfect home. </p><br /><h2 id='before-you-start'>Before you start</h2><br /><p>There are three important things to consider: </p><p>1. <strong>Where in <a target='_blank' href='https://visitberlin.de/en/neighbourhoods-berlin'>Berlin</a> do you want to live?</strong> You can use tools such as this <a target='_blank' href='https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/mietkarte-berlin/'>interactive chart</a> to help determine where you can afford to live. </p><p>2. <strong>Do you want to live in a shared flat or in your own apartment?</strong> A shared flat in Germany is typically referred to as a WG - short for <em>Wohngemeinschaft</em>.</p><p>3. <strong>What features should your new home have?</strong> It&#39;s important to consider factors such as the number of rooms, which amenities are included, and on which floor you&#39;d like to live. Features such as a balcony can be nice, but keep in mind they can also limit your available options! </p><br /><h2 id='finding-your-new-home-fast'>Finding your new home fast</h2><br /><p>4. <strong>Keep an open mind, and be flexible:</strong> It’s tough, but true. Although it is important to know what you want in a new home, your chances will ultimately increase if you are also willing to make compromises! It’s also important to be patient. This process takes time, and it is normal to go through several viewings before finding the right place. (Think of it like job hunting: you’ll send applications, have multiple interviews, and finally the right offer will be on the table!)</p><p><em>Bonus Tip:</em> The most important thing to know when looking at the price of a rental flat is the difference between “Warmmiete” and “Kaltmiete.” <em>Kaltmiete</em> translates to “cold rent,” and is the basic rent for the apartment without taking into account any additional costs. <em>Warmmiete</em> translates to “warm rent,” and includes the Kaltmiete plus additional costs such as water, property tax, gas, electricity, and waste disposal services. (These “side costs” are called <em>Nebenkosten</em> in German.) </p><p>5. <strong>Harness the power of social media:</strong> This point is especially relevant for EU residents that have an existing social network within Europe, but is useful for everyone in the era of the internet. Much like with your job search, success in your housing hunt depends on your existing network of friends and acquaintances. In Berlin especially, you will have greater success applying for a flat through a personal connection. </p><p>How should you get the word out? Use your social media presence such as Facebook or Twitter! Even if you currently live outside Europe, you probably have connections you aren’t even aware of. You might be surprised how many of your Facebook friends know someone who has a friend who knows someone currently living in Germany. They might be able to help you out! </p><p align='center'><img alt='Honeypot mascot, Bearpot, holding a megaphone.' src='/assets/images/megaphone-bearpot.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br> <p><em>Bonus Tip:</em> Optimize your Social Media outreach. Share your post when most of your friends and connections are online (such as in the evening between 8pm and 9pm). Use pictures and hashtags (#) to make your post stand out. Ask your followers to like and share your post to extend your reach and keep your post visible for a longer period of time. You may even want to consider investing in paid ads to further expand your outreach. </p><p>6. <strong>Set up automatic alerts:</strong> Most apartment and shared flat platforms allow you to generate automatic email alerts if a new offer is posted that matches your requirements. You’ll have much better luck if you are one of the first to see a post. If many people have already responded, it’s less likely that you’ll get a reply. </p><p><em>Bonus Tip:</em> If you are looking for something short-term for your first days or weeks after your arrival in Berlin (but you don’t want to spend your time at a hotel or hostel), we suggest you explore short term rental websites such as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.airbnb.de/stay/bvb'>Airbnb</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.wimdu.de/'>Wimdu</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.homeaway.com/'>HomeAway</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://wunderflats.com/en/'>Wunderflats</a>! </p><p>7. <strong>Know the secrets of searching online:</strong> Look where no one else does! 90% of people searching for housing will be searching on the same, well-known platforms. Therefore, it is helpful to look on lesser known online portals. You may also want to search at times when fewer people are online (for example, ads tend to be placed early in the morning or late at night) to make sure you are reaching out to the most recent offers. </p><p><em>Bonus Tip:</em> There are several large groups and pages on Facebook focused on apartment hunting in Berlin. You may also want to consider joining smaller groups (ideally with less than 200 or so members) to increase your chances of getting a response!</p><p>8. <strong>Always try for direct contact:</strong> If there is a phone number provided in the ad, always call directly. In the time of Whatsapp, you can even leave a voice message! This is a great option as many people work during the week and may not be able to answer a call. Leaving a voice message gives them the opportunity to listen whenever they have time – whether it’s in the Ubahn on the way to work, at the gym, or during a lunch break. It’s a great way to introduce yourself and explain your situation. </p><p>9. <strong>Be creative and brazen:</strong> Try putting up an apartment or housing request in the form of a note at busy areas around your desired living location. This could be in a café, at your favorite gym or yoga studio, or even on a telephone pole. </p><p><em>Bonus Tip:</em> Do you already have a specific neighborhood in mind? If so, try to find supermarkets in or around this area. Many stores have a “<em>schwarzes Brett für Anzeigen,</em>” a board where ads can be placed for selling, buying, and renting!</p><p>10. <strong>Always keep required documents on hand:</strong> If you are looking for a flat, you must arrange the following documents and take them with you to viewings. In many cases your application will not be accepted if these documents are incomplete or missing: </p><ul><li>Copy of personal ID </li><li>“<em>SCHUFA Auskunft</em>” – credit report (SCHUFA is a credit investigation company) </li><li>“<em>Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung</em>” - Certificate of Rent Paid </li><li>You may also need an assurance signed by a guarantor (for example: your parents) and proof of their payslips from the past 3 months if you cannot provide a confirmation of your own income yet. Depending on the landlord, your contract of employment could also be enough proof. </li></ul><p align='center'><img alt='Honeypot mascot, Bearpot, holding a clipboard.' src='/assets/images/clipboard-bearpot.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br> <p>11. <strong>Let the viewing marathon begin:</strong> This stage can be exhausting and frustrating for many flat hunters. The good news is that once you have conquered the apartment obstacle, you will feel as though you have finally arrived in Berlin – what a relief! Here are some important things to keep in mind to make it through your apartment viewings: </p><ul><li>Dress nicely, be friendly and polite, and shake the estate agent’s hand – in order to be successful, you must stand out from the crowd. A nice appearance and friendly demeanor will help you score extra points against your “competitors.” </li><li>Make sure to hand in a copy of all your documents <em>in person at the viewing.</em></li><li>After the viewing, send a second copy of your documents to the agency or landlord as quickly as possible via email.</li><li>In your email, thank the landlord or property agent for the tour and let them know how much you enjoyed the viewing. </li></ul><br /><h2 id='an-important-note-about-scams'>An important note about scams!</h2><br /><p>Given Berlin’s competitive housing market, it’s natural for renters to feel pressure to find a flat. Because of this, people may sometimes try to take advantage and attempt to trick you -- especially in cases when there are many people applying for the same flat. </p><p>Follow these quick DOs and DON’Ts to save yourself from falling victim to a scam: </p><p>12. <strong>DON’T ever pay a deposit in cash!</strong> Although this practice is common in other countries, it is not the norm in Berlin and you should be suspicious of anyone who asks you for a cash deposit. If you pay in cash and you do get scammed (fingers crossed this will never happen to you), you will have no way of proving that you transferred the money. This makes it nearly impossible to file any claim or report the scam to the police.</p><p>13. <strong>DO always have a valid contract set up!</strong> If you are not sure about the contract because it is written in German, please ask a German speaker to go over the contract with you before you sign anything. Any upstanding landlord will understand your need to take time to check that everything is legitimate. </p><p>14. <strong>DO conduct your own research about the landlord!</strong> Look for any suspicious signs. Ask them for pictures, or for their social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) accounts, and call if you have not met in person yet. Always ask for a viewing - if they decline saying they are abroad and want you to send them the deposit first, this is a clear sign of a scam! Also be wary of landlords whose phone number or current address do not match the country of their bank account. </p><p>15. <strong>DON’T fall for scam emails!</strong> Many scam networks have set up automated emails trying to reach as many people as possible – they do not hesitate to target everyone, regardless of gender, age, or background. Please do not trust someone you have not met face to face, even if they send you a scan of their passport, bank statement, address, or the contract with a signature. And of course do NOT transfer money (especially via Western Union) under any circumstances!</p><p>Follow these tips, and you’ll be on your way to finding your dream flat in no time. Happy house hunting! </p>",

      "id": "2019-05-13-lydia-hallie-interview",
      "contents": "<p>We recently caught up with the talented, young Dutch developer Lydia Hallie for a quick chat about <strong>starting to program, important coding languages, and how her 2017 Medium article ‘Advice from a 19 Year Old Girl &amp; Software Developer’ helped her to create a nexus with the developer community.</strong> Her do-it-yourself attitude and engaging, fun personality made it a blast to get to know her.</p><br /><h3 id='how-would-you-describe-yourself'>How would you describe yourself?</h3><br /><p>I’m a software developer who mainly works with JavaScript and web development. I really try to share my passion for programming with other people by talking about my experiences and coding journey online on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Medium. When I’m not busy coding, you can probably find me mentoring people or sharing coding tutorials. I just want to help make the tech world less intimidating and scary for people.</p><br /><h3 id='which-programming-languages-do-you-mainly-work-with'>Which programming languages do you mainly work with?</h3><br /><p>I work a lot with JavaScript, both front and backend, but I really try to play around with other languages like C++, Ruby and Python as well.</p><br /><h3 id='why-the-interest-in-all-the-different-coding-languages'>Why the interest in all the different coding languages?</h3><br /><p>I think it’s good to know multiple coding languages because the more languages you are familiar with, the better you can understand coding languages in general. You can comprehend why things are implemented in a certain way if you know how they’re implemented in other languages. Especially knowing how things work “under the hood” and seeing why certain design decisions were made is extremely beneficial for your understanding of a language. I think it&#39;s great for your own progress. For me, even though JavaScript is growing so fast compared to pretty much everything else, studying multiple languages is critical.</p><br /><h3 id='do-you-get-excited-when-you-start-learning-a-new-coding-language'>Do you get excited when you start learning a new coding language?</h3><br /><p>Definitely! I really like to study and get out of my comfort zone. Whenever I’m learning a new language and it’s awkward and uncomfortable, I just feel myself growing and getting better at it. That’s what motivates me the most in programming. It’s amazing to experience personal growth and know that while last week I couldn&#39;t do this, it’s no problem at all now.</p><br /><h3 id='how-did-you-initially-get-into-web-development'>How did you initially get into web development?</h3><br /><p>Initially I had a blog on Tumblr. I was all into yoga and healthy lifestyles, and I started to write and post about it. I didn’t like the standard blog layouts and when I found a custom one that I liked, it was €50! I didn’t have that money at the time. It was possible to change your own layout with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I had no idea how to do that. I started to study and learn more about them and then after high school, I realized that this was an actual career option. I got so happy because I’d already been developing for the last five years. It was all kind of accidental.</p><br /><h3 id='wow-so-you-started-coding-at-15-years-old'>Wow, so you started coding at 15 years old?</h3><br /><p>Yea, I was 15 when I started to really build things myself, however I had no idea that this was coding in a way, I was just doing it for fun. When I was even younger than that, I got introduced to coding by making small games in python and later on started to use R to analyze data for school.</p><br /><h3 id='you-went-to-the-iron-yard-coding-school-in-florida-could-you-tell-us-more-about-that-and-take-us-through-the-career-path-that-got-you-here-today'>You went to The Iron Yard coding school in Florida. Could you tell us more about that and take us through the career path that got you here today?</h3><br /><p>I finished high school, took my gap year, and after that I was thinking about what I should do next. Was I ready to go to university? Was I sure that I wouldn’t regret choosing a certain bachelor? ? It was scary stuff. Everyone around me wanted me to pursue higher education. I have family in Florida, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to go to America and study at a coding school. Seeing the career options that developers can have right now and how happy I am while I’m coding, I know that I chose the right career path.</p><p>I think the working environment in the U.S. is so much better than Europe. Well, things are changing, but still very different. I went to become better at the latest cutting-edge technologies. I knew JavaScript and others, but I hadn’t studied React or other modern frameworks. It was really fun to be surrounded by other people who were just as motivated as me to start a programming career! Especially since my classmates were all so diverse.</p><br /><h3 id='is-the-working-culture-different-in-america-compared-to-europe'>Is the working culture different in America compared to Europe?</h3><br /><p>Yes, definitely. I think that it’s generally easier in America to pursue a coding career as the entire culture is different. Although I have to admit that this is changing very fast and Europe is getting much better at it, most companies are still based in the US that often organize the best conferences and meetups. The US is always one step ahead of Europe, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s definitely different!</p><br /><h3 id='do-you-go-to-meetups-yourself-as-well'>Do you go to meetups yourself as well?</h3><br /><p>I really try to! I’m always kind of traveling around though so that makes it hard. It’s nice to go to meetups and talk with new people, but I don&#39;t always have time. It’s still a bit overwhelming to go to meetups on your own, especially when you’re like 19 or 20. It can be hard sometimes to be taken serious and show that I’m really passionate about programming, but it’s really fun to meet so many new people in this community who are all very supportive!</p><br /><h3 id='what-are-you-working-on-nowadays'>What are you working on nowadays?</h3><br /><p>Besides my regular job, I’m basically always making tutorials, mentoring people, and working on my own projects. I’m collaborating with teams of new developers. They work on coding, and I help them to get better as they go along. The last couple of weeks have been super busy with mentoring, which also helps me to learn new things for myself.  I constantly take on more projects and expand my knowledge. I could get stuck in my projects forever.</p><br /><h3 id='do-you-learn-new-languages-to-be-able-to-mentor-others-or-for-your-own-development'>Do you learn new languages to be able to mentor others or for your own development?</h3><br /><p>I learn them for my own development or whenever I need to use them in my personal projects. I don&#39;t feel comfortable mentoring people if I just learned something myself, you know? I might be totally misunderstanding something. Web development is something that I’m 100% comfortable with, so I can have fun mentoring people in that. I also learn so much just by teaching people, and seeing them improve is just the best feeling in the world.</p><br /><h3 id='so-you-mostly-teach-people-about-technical-skills-technology-or-more-than-that'>So, you mostly teach people about technical skills, technology, or more than that?</h3><br /><p>It varies from person to person. Everyone is different. Sometimes people just don&#39;t know how to stay motivated or how to get started in coding. Besides the technical skills like how to use JavaScript, the terminal, and stuff like that, I also provide more personal, emotional support, which is also very fun and rewarding as well. It’s especially hard to start coding if you don’t have outside support, something many people don’t have.</p><br /><h3 id='do-you-schedule-calls-with-them'>Do you schedule calls with them?</h3><br /><p>I basically have one-hour Skype calls or sometimes screen shares with people and then I just make small coding challenges or workflows for them so that they have references and all that.</p><br /><h3 id='do-you-make-your-own-coding-challenges-as-well'>Do you make your own coding challenges as well?</h3><br /><p>Haha, yes! It’s really fun to do. Sometimes I don&#39;t even know the answer. I’ll tell the coders to solve my challenge, see what solutions they come up with, and go over it with them. I sometimes give them a real-life problem I’ve been struggling with in my own projects to see how they would solve it haha, it’s a win-win!</p><br /><h3 id='how-many-people-do-you-coach-right-now'>How many people do you coach right now?</h3><br /><p>I’ve tried to cut back a little bit recently, so probably around 10 people right now. People stop and start up again quite frequently, so it’s hard to say how many total people, but definitely quite a few.</p><br /><h3 id='is-this-to-make-a-living-or-something-you-do-voluntarily'>Is this to make a living or something you do voluntarily?</h3><br /><p>This is something that I do on the side. Of course, I’ve made some money from it, but that&#39;s not my main goal.</p><br /> <h3 id='lets-jump-into-your-medium-articles-for-a-bit-one-of-your-articles-was-about-advice-for-teenage-developers-what-advice-would-you-give-them'>Let’s jump into your Medium articles for a bit. One of your articles was about advice for teenage developers. What advice would you give them?</h3><br /><p>Hmm, well this piece of advice isn’t necessarily just for teenagers, but it’s very important to get your name out there. Honestly, that’s the best thing that happened to me for my career, even though I absolutely never expected that my article would get this much attention! It doesn’t matter how good you are when you’re just starting out, but you should share your journey on social media like Twitter and Instagram. You can motivate yourself and others this way. You have to keep on going to share content and not give up on yourself. Sharing like this when you’re more junior can have some disadvantages though. It’s hard not to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of senior developers who can criticize you and the way you code online. You can learn from this criticism, but you just have to ignore the negativity, get through it, and tune out the haters. Haha, I don’t want to get too negative here, but it’s something you have to be aware of.</p><br /><h3 id='how-do-you-deal-with-that-yourself'>How do you deal with that yourself?</h3><br /><p>When my articles first started to blow up, it was definitely hard to deal with because everyone was trying to prove that I was faking it. I was OK with it, but it was hard to deal with all the criticism. Right now, I’m just totally numb to it. When I see it, I just laugh and ignore it and just keep on coding and improving myself. It’s hard when you’re not used to it and have to deal with it for the first time.</p><br /><h3 id='what-new-technologies-or-languages-do-you-think-new-developers-should-focus-on'>What new technologies or languages do you think new developers should focus on?</h3><br /><p>It depends what you want to get out of it. If you just want to make money fast, then focus on JavaScript because there are so many jobs right now, and it’s not that hard to learn either if you’re truly motivated and a good learner. Otherwise the tech world is moving so fast that it’s hard to say what you should focus on now, because almost every week a new thing is released. I’m very happy that I focused on JavaScript though. It’s given me so many amazing opportunities.</p><br /><h3 id='why-did-you-first-start-sharing-on-social-media-and-when-did-it-really-take-off'>Why did you first start sharing on social media and when did it really take off?</h3><br /><p>I was trying to find more people to connect with in the coding world, so I went to Instagram and saw that there were more people doing the same thing that I was doing. I was like that looks fun and I want to connect with them. I think it was last summer that I started posting on Instagram. Being on Instagram also worked to motivate myself along with other people.  I believe that coding shouldn&#39;t be seen as this weird genius-type thing, you know? </p><p>I started sharing my pictures and got into contact with so many developers, and I think things really started to take off when I wrote the Medium article. At the time, I had around 10,000 followers on Instagram, and had many people asking me ‘What’s your life like?’ “Did you go to university?” and things like that, so I wrote a Medium article thinking that only 80 people would read it. I thought it was nothing special, but the views really surpassed all my expectations.</p><br /><h3 id='what-was-the-timespan-for-that-rise-in-readership'>What was the timespan for that rise in readership?</h3><br /><p>I remember publishing the article and the very next day it had 800 claps on Medium. I was like freaking out and thinking it was so crazy. I didn&#39;t look at it for three days after that and then it had 20,000 claps, and I was in shock. <em>[Editor’s Note: It’s now up to 92,000 as of May, 2019.]</em> </p><p>I almost had a heart attack.  It was incredibly fast and then I started receiving phone calls, emails, and everyone was adding me as a friend on social media. It was overwhelming, especially when people from Google and Amazon, and very big newspapers were reaching out to me. I just kind of ignored all of them, which I shouldn’t have. But it was just too much for me and I couldn&#39;t handle it at that time.</p><br /><h3 id='moving-back-to-web-development-and-open-source-do-you-enjoy-being-a-web-developer-and-if-so-what-do-you-like-about-it'>Moving back to web development and open source, do you enjoy being a web developer? And if so, what do you like about it?</h3><br /><p>Well, I really enjoy doing this right now, but it’s not something I want to do for the rest of my life. It’s been a great first step into the tech world. What I like about it most is that it’s so different and varied. Each project I work on, I work on something completely different and when I have my own idea, I can actually make it into a reality. Even for a business or app idea, I can just go ahead and build it. It gives you so much freedom. It&#39;s a lot of work, especially with how fast things are changing. Seriously, there’s something new to learn every week, but it’s worth it.</p><br /><h3 id='are-you-an-open-source-contributor'>Are you an open-source contributor?</h3><br /><p>No, not right now. I’m working on my own projects that are open source, but I haven’t contributed to anything open source yet. It’s a bit scary to do for me. I don&#39;t know why. My mind just tells me that people will judge me, haha. Hopefully I can get over that apprehension and start soon.</p><br /><h3 id='what-projects-are-you-working-on-then'>What projects are you working on then?</h3><br /><p>I have several. I’m working on platforms that will make it easier for developers to learn other languages and to connect with other developers. They’re projects for stuff that I’m missing personally right now. That&#39;s the main thing. You don’t want me to start getting into all the technical details. I’ll never stop and you’ll be bored soon enough.</p><br /><h3 id='are-things-working-out-in-general-for-you'>Are things working out in general for you?</h3><br /><p>Yea! The projects I’m building with other people, my juniors, are really fun. It feels so good to watch them grow and be happy that they can help contribute.</p><br /><h3 id='how-do-they-give-you-feedback-and-communicate-with-you'>How do they give you feedback and communicate with you?</h3><br /><p>We all use Slack. I tell them things to do, have trial reports, and work together. It’s great.</p><br /><h3 id='in-your-opinion-what-is-europes-tech-capital-and-why'>In your opinion, what is Europe’s tech capital and why?</h3><br /><p>Wow, that’s hard. I think that Berlin is pretty great. I didn’t realize just how great it was before, but I’m finding that there are so many good companies there. I feel it’s a very good environment for developers as well. I don’t really know about other cities, however I’ve seen that London and Amsterdam are also really attractive for developers.</p><br /><h3 id='what-aspects-are-important-for-a-city-to-have-a-good-environment-for-developers'>What aspects are important for a city to have a good environment for developers?</h3><br /><p>Having a lot of meetups and possibilities to reach out to other developers, at least for me, is the biggest single factor. I don&#39;t want to feel isolated. You need to communicate with others in order to grow. It&#39;s also important to have a large number of startups and other small companies. A city needs to have people with good entrepreneurial spirit. It can’t just have an older generation of developers being cranky about the new generation. There’s a lot of that around here, and it’s not very motivating. I want to be around younger people with motivation to open their own businesses.</p><br /><h3 id='how-do-you-see-javascript-and-the-web-in-general-in-the-next-five-to-ten-years'>How do you see JavaScript and the web in general in the next five to ten years?</h3><br /><p>That’s so difficult to say. Even just five years ago it was so different.  We didn&#39;t even have React yet. There will be so many new technologies that will make it faster and easier for developers. There’s even software now that generates code for you based on your input and design. I’m really interested to see how that will go and to see if developers will even still be necessary. They will definitely be relevant to some extent but not in the same way as now.  I can see that happening in the next 5-10 years. That&#39;ll be fun. Maybe it’s a good time to step out of web development before that happens, haha.</p><br /><h3 id='in-what-fields-do-you-see-jobs-being-available-in'>In what fields do you see jobs being available in?</h3><br /><p>Again, it’s very hard to say due to the speed of technological advances, but I imagine that machine learning will be important.  I also think web optimization and backend stuff will also have plenty of jobs.  Those will always be very much sought after.</p><br /><h3 id='if-our-followers-want-to-get-to-know-you-better-where-can-they-find-you'>If our followers want to get to know you better, where can they find you?</h3><br /><p>Social media all the way. I’m on <a target='_blank' href='https://www.instagram.com/theavocoder/'>Instagram</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.twitter.com/lydia_hallie'>Twitter</a>.

      "contents": "<p>To succeed in today’s fast-paced and hyper-connected world, <strong>it is critically important for companies to find and retain the very best technical talent to propel growth.</strong> Across Germany, companies are adapting their sourcing, hiring, and onboarding processes to attract talent-- and the growing shortage of technical talent across Europe means <strong>candidates are increasingly coming from abroad.</strong> </p><p>Whether you are a company looking to hire international talent or a developer trying to figure out how to move to Germany, it’s important to understand both the process and the options available to you.</p><br /><h2 id='german-work-permits-the-basics'>German work permits: the basics</h2><p>To work in Germany as a non-German citizen, you will need a work permit and a residency permit. EU nationals can enter the country and search for work without a permit, but non-EU citizens will likely require a job offer and work permit before entering the country, and must apply for a residency permit immediately. </p><br /><h2 id='am-i-eligible-for-a-german-work-permit'>Am I eligible for a German work permit?</h2><p>You may already be aware of the EU Blue Card, a specialized work visa with strict education and salary requirements (if not, you can read more about it <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/ultimate-guide-EU-blue-card/'>here</a>-- but what about developers who don’t have the required university degree, or who hold a degree in an unrelated subject? </p><p>Both the <a target='_blank' href='https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/10/07/do-developers-need-college-degrees/'>tech landscape</a> and the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.fastcompany.com/3069259/why-more-tech-companies-are-hiring-people-without-degrees'>attitudes of hiring managers</a> have changed in recent years. With the proliferation of self-directed programs such as coding bootcamps and <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/leeb/status/1142757659248123904'>self-directed tutorials</a>, it is becoming increasingly common for developers to forgo the traditional university degree. This shift is good news for hiring managers looking for new sources of talent and for developers without a traditional degree, and whether you’re a hiring manager or a developer, the German work permit is your ticket to a happy and productive working life in Germany!  </p><p>The German work permit provides the <strong>same working rights as a Blue Card</strong> without the requirement of a university degree. As a developer, if your salary is within the average range for your role and your employer can justify their choice to hire you over a local applicant, you are likely eligible for this working visa. </p><p>Read on to discover everything you need to know about the German work permit and its requirements. </p><br /><h2 id='the-d-type-visa'>The D-Type Visa</h2><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Bearpot parachuting down from above.' src='/assets/images/parachute.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br><p>For tech professionals from most countries*, the first step of the process will be the <strong>entry visa (or D-type visa)</strong>. This is typically issued by the German embassy in your current country of residence, and allows you to begin working as soon as you arrive in Germany. In most cases, the D-type visa is issued for 3-6 months and can be converted into a more permanent work permit within that time frame. </p><p>According to the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ihk-berlin.de/English/en/Working_in_Berlin/Visa/Employees_from_third_countries/2260070'>German Chamber of Commerce</a>, there are several prerequisites in order to qualify for a D-type visa: </p><ul><li>A concrete job offer has been made. </li><li>No adverse consequences for the labour market arise from the employment of foreign staff</li><li>No privileged employees (i.e. Germans, EU citizens, citizens of EEA States) are available for the job</li><li>The foreign worker is not employed on less favourable terms than those which apply to comparable German workers</li></ul><p>*<strong>Exceptions</strong>: Citizens of Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and the United States of America can also enter Germany without a D-type visa and may obtain a residence permit directly from the immigration office in Germany.</p><p><strong>*NOTE:</strong> <em>A Type C &quot;Tourist visa or Schengen visa&quot; cannot be converted into a residence permit!</em></p><br /><h2 id='what-is-the-zav'>What is the ZAV?</h2><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Bearpot holding a clipboard.' src='/assets/images/clipboard.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br><p>The office of <strong>International Placement Services</strong> (Zentrale Auslands- und Fachvermittlung, or ZAV for short) is responsible for granting work permits and approving residence permits. The ZAV is a division of the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/en/welcome'>German Federal Employment Agency</a> that helps employers all over Germany to find employees for their vacancies and helps employees integrate into the German labor market.</p><p>You will most likely encounter this agency during the <strong>pre-approval</strong> process in advance of your embassy appointment. Pre-approval is not always required by the embassy, but is helpful in most cases. In order to request pre-approval from the ZAV, there are several important documents you will need: </p><ul><li>Work contract, signed by the company</li><li>Job description form, “<a target='_blank' href='https://con.arbeitsagentur.de/prod/apok/ct/dam/download/documents/dok_ba015716.pdf'>Stellenbeschreibung</a>” </li><li>Proof of qualifications, which can be either a university degree or relevant work experience </li><li>Justification letter from the company explaining why you are the best candidate for the position</li><li>Application for permission to work, “<a target='_blank' href='https://www.berlin.de/labo/_assets/zuwanderung/antrag-auf-erlaubnis-einer-beschaeftigung.pdf'>Antrag auf Erlaubnis einer Beschäftigung</a>” </li></ul><p>No worries - whether you are a developer or a company hiring from abroad, Honeypot will help you to fill out and assemble these documents. We’ll even mail them to the ZAV and follow up on your case along the way! </p><br /><h2 id='the-residence-permit'>The Residence Permit</h2><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Bearpot wearing an apron and an oven mit.' src='/assets/images/apron.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br><p>Once you have arrived in Germany, the first thing you’ll want to do (if you haven’t already) is <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/15-tips-finding-a-flat-berlin/'>find a flat</a> and register your new address with the local authorities. You’ll also want to set up German health insurance. You will need proof of both in order to apply for a residence and work permit before your D-type visa expires. </p><p>In comparison to the temporary D-type visa, the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.germany-visa.org/german-residence-permit/'>residence permit</a> is issued for the duration of your work contract. If the work contract is unlimited, the permit will typically be valid for 4 years.</p><p><strong>The right to work in Germany (and to what extent you can work) will be detailed on your residence permit.</strong> Your permit will usually be linked to your employer, which means that if you want to change jobs you will need to get approval from the Federal Employment Agency. </p><br /><h2 id='frequently-asked-questions'>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Bearpot with a concerned look on his face.' src='/assets/images/questions.png' style='width:25% !important;'></p><br><h3 id='what-about-my-family'>What about my family?</h3><p>Third-country nationals who are legally living in Germany can bring over their spouse or registered partner and children, provided that certain conditions are met: </p><ul><li><p>The spouse of a work permit holder typically needs to have basic German language skills at an A1 level. (Exception: Citizens of Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and the United States of America.)</p></li><li><p>The spouse who holds the original work permit will also need to prove sufficient income and registration at a flat which is big enough to host more than one person. </p></li></ul><p>The beauty of the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.germany-visa.org/family-reunion-visa/'>Family Reunion visa in Germany</a> is that it also allows the partner full working rights without the requirement of a work permit or Blue Card. </p><h3 id='what-if-i-want-to-leave-the-eu-for-an-extended-time'>What if I want to leave the EU for an extended time?</h3><p>Planning to travel? Keep in mind that your work permit will expire if you leave Germany for more than 6 months. A longer period may be allowed by request, for example, if you are required to go on assignment abroad. In most cases, you will need to apply for an exemption. </p><h3 id='what-if-i-already-have-a-work-permit-for-another-eu-country'>What if I already have a work permit for another EU country?</h3><p>Each EU member state issues work and residency permits independently, so you will need to go to the German embassy or consulate in your current country of residence to apply for a D-type visa that will allow you to begin working in Germany. </p><h3 id='what-if-i-want-to-move-to-another-country'>What if I want to move to another country?</h3><p>If you plan to move from Germany to another country, you will need to apply for a work permit for your new country. The process and requirements for this can vary, but typically you will need to visit the new country’s local embassy in Germany. It is always best to check the embassy website of your new country to be sure of all requirements in advance. </p><h3 id='what-if-i-want-to-convert-my-work-permit-to-a-blue-card'>What if I want to convert my work permit to a Blue Card?</h3><p>If you did not qualify for a Blue Card previously, but have since increased your salary, finished your university degree, or had your university degree officially recognized, it is now possible to convert your work permit to an EU Blue Card. You can make an appointment with your local Foreign Office in order to submit the updated documents. </p><p><strong>*Note:</strong> <em>Keep in mind that there are two main benefits to the Blue Card: easier family reunification and a quicker path to permanent residency. If you are single (or your family has already arrived), and you have held a work permit for two years or more, it is worth considering that the bureaucratic process may not be worth the benefit you would receive from a Blue Card.</em></p><h3 id='what-if-i-want-to-become-a-permanent-resident'>What if I want to become a permanent resident?</h3><p>Permanent residency is possible after living in Germany for 5 years with an uninterrupted residence permit (including a work permit). In specific cases, it is possible earlier, for example if you hold a German university degree or an EU Blue Card. </p><h3 id='how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-work-permit-in-germany'>How long does it take to get a work permit in Germany?</h3><p>Typically, the office of International Placement Services (ZAV) will process a work permit in 1-3 months after the application has been submitted. </p><h3 id='how-much-is-a-german-work-visa'>How much is a German work visa?</h3><p>Submitting an application for a short-stay German work visa costs €60 Euro, while an application for a long-stay visa is €75. However, applicants under the age of 18 can submit an application for only €37.50. </p><h3 id='how-long-can-you-stay-in-germany-with-a-work-visa'>How long can you stay in Germany with a work visa?</h3><p>Typically, a work visa is granted for the same length of time as the applicant’s work contract: so, if your contract is for two years, then the work visa will last two years. </p><br /><h2 id='ready-set-go'>Ready, set, go!</h2><br /><p>All told, the German work permit certainly gets the job done.

It was surprising that they were not only interested in my professional skills but also were curious about my motivation for moving to Berlin. </p><p>I was excited about working with people from different cultures and seeing if they do things differently than what I am used to. However, I was worried about not having good communication with my colleagues. Despite the fact that I speak English and have worked with American clients, this is my first fully English-immersed job.</p><h3 id='preparing-things-at-home'>Preparing things at home...</h3><p>It was easy to book the embassy appointment -- the challenging part was to prepare the required documentation, find a certificated German translator for the curriculum vitae and diplomas, and then request the apostilles.</p><p>Before the move I had to cancel all the services I was subscribed to like gym, mobile, cable-TV, etc. I also had to inform my bank about the move and find a secure way to send money to my relatives in Colombia (I am using Azimo). In my case I also had to sell my car and undergo some medical tests to check my physical condition.</p><h3 id='arriving-in-germany'>Arriving in Germany...</h3><p>The flight was exhausting but without issues, and I had no trouble doing the border control check, as I presented the ZAV pre-approval (sent by the Honeypot team to my home) and the visa. I was surprised how easy is to move around Berlin with the train system and Google maps!</p><p>The job is good so far. The company has more employees than I thought (the day I entered, another 19 people entered as well!), but the working environment is great.</p><h3 id='support-from-honeypot'>Support from Honeypot...</h3><p>The support I received from the Honeypot team was excellent. They wrote very clear emails with each step of the process and also sent a follow-up email very so often to help me with any doubts. The response time was very fast all the time.</p><br /><h2 id='paulo'>Paulo</h2><br /> <p align='center'><img alt='Male software developer smiling and holding a sign that reads 'I am Tipico,' his new company.' src='/assets/images/Paulo_spotlight.png' style='width:50% !important;'></p><br><p>Software Developer at <strong>Tipico</strong><br>Recife, Brazil &#x2192; Budapest, Hungary &#x2192; Karlsruhe, Germany</p><h3 id='trying-honeypot'>Trying Honeypot...</h3><p>I thought the idea of having the companies look for me instead of the other way around was interesting and made me feel valuable to the market.</p><p>I always wanted to live and work abroad. I had decided that when I had the chance, I’d move out of Brazil. I moved to Hungary, but my work there was as an intern, so it didn’t pay very well. After I started receiving offers from many different companies on Honeypot, I decided to investigate which country could provide me and my wife with the best quality of life. And Germany was the choice. I feel that Germany has more empathy with people than most countries. They have an environment-friendly mindset too!</p><h3 id='choosing-tipico'>Choosing Tipico...</h3><p>I knew Tipico was the one when they brought me to Karlsruhe for the “Meet the Team” day. They did the code challenge after the Meet The Team day, which was unusual, but because I saw the company first I felt very motivated to give my best and I eventually was approved by them. My feedback was very positive.</p><p>Even though I was far from being hired, when I visited the company in person I felt a strong sense of unity, teamwork, even family. I saw that they genuinely cared about their employees. That was very important to me.</p><h3 id='first-days-at-the-new-job'>First days at the new job...</h3><p>Everything was perfect! I felt so welcomed. Bogdan (another Honeypot talent) was living in the same flat as me. Good guy. Gave me Russian chocolate! </p><p>They received me so well, everyone. I met a lot of people and had a lot of training sessions. They have free coffee, free soda, free cereal. I got a MacBook (I had never used one before). Everything is perfect here!</p><p>The company provided an apartment for me to live in for two months, paying only the maintenance costs, which really helped a lot. I was also surprised to receive a Welcome Basket on my first day. I don&#39;t know if this is standard here in Germany, but it makes me value my job as much as they value me as an employee!</p><h3 id='first-impressions-of-karlsruhe'>First impressions of Karlsruhe...</h3><p>I went to the city center to buy some clothes. The transportation here is the only thing that doesn&#39;t seem as practical as in Budapest, but this is not the capital of the country and I actually prefer living here than living in the capital. It&#39;s quiet and peaceful. At the same time, they have all the main shops and malls. Everyone I interacted with in markets and shops spoke English. </p><p>I think this is a nice place to grow old in. I can see myself settling down here.

For me, the hardest part of finding a job was that in Turkey we don’t usually speak in English during our daily life. Dutch people are much more proficient in daily English. In the beginning, it was a bit of a problem because my speaking skills were rusty, but after a few interviews it got better. It is still sometimes a problem if I’m explaining something in detail or talking about a specific problem, but in daily life and around the office, it&#39;s not a problem anymore. </p><p>Most of the companies I interviewed with seemed more open. In the Netherlands, you can speak more directly with people. This was very different from companies I’ve worked at in Turkey. Dutch companies give you more freedom to do things on your own. You don’t need to ask about everything. In my current company, there is no vertical hierarchy or middle managers. </p><h3 id='initial-fears'>Initial fears...</h3><p>I was excited about living in another country and experiencing another culture, as well as working on new things. In the beginning, I was a little nervous about what would happen if I really didn’t like the company or the Netherlands or if I didn’t fit in well. After about two months though, that worry definitely disappeared. I feel like I fit in really well! </p><p>This is my first time working in the Netherlands, and because I went through Honeypot I was less worried about what would happen if something went wrong. I was less worried about having my questions answered too, since there is a person dedicated to helping me with this transition. It was easier to feel relaxed and enjoy the process. </p><h3 id='getting-ready-to-move'>Getting ready to move...</h3><p>It was very easy for me to book the embassy appointment. They didn’t ask me for anything extra - only my passport, a letter from my new company, and my birth certificate. I got my temporary visa and was ready to go. I also found a temporary place to stay in the Netherlands before leaving Turkey. </p><p>I had visited the Netherlands three years before I moved, so I was familiar with the airport and public transportation. My company also hired another Turkish guy from Honeypot, so we already met in Turkey before we moved. It was really nice to already know someone there.  </p><h3 id='the-biggest-differences'>The biggest differences...</h3><p>The autonomy was the biggest thing I noticed as being different from Turkey. We are all coming from different cultures and backgrounds, but in our roots all of us are writing and developing software. Because of this, we have a common point and all of us understand each other. </p><p>I did notice that Dutch people eat a lot of bread. They eat a lot of cold dishes for lunch, which was not a familiar thing in Turkey. We prefer hot lunches and hot dinners. </p><h3 id='on-using-honeypot'>On using Honeypot...</h3><p>With Honeypot you write your skills and past career and experience, and after that you know that companies really read your CV. If they provide what you are looking for, they will send an invitation to you and you can accept if you’re interested. It is shifting roles and I think it’s a good thing for a developer to be able to choose what he or she wants to do. </p><h3 id='advice-for-international-developers'>Advice for international developers...</h3><p>If you think you are suitable enough with your personal life, your family life, and your technical experience, everyone should try this kind of experience. Meeting people from different cultures and improving your English and seeing other technologies is a once-in-a-lifetime thing that everyone should try. </p><br /><h2 id='emiliano'>Emiliano</h2><br /> <p align='center'><img alt='Male software developer smiling in front of the water in his new home in Hamburg.' src='/assets/images/Emiliano_spotlight.png' style='width:50% !important;'></p><br><p>Senior Frontend Developer at <strong>Car2Go GmbH</strong><br>Buenos Aires, Argentina &#x2192; Hamburg, Germany</p><h3 id='deciding-to-come-to-germany'>Deciding to come to Germany...</h3><p>As a developer, I was always exposed to working remotely with people from different places: companies from North America, clients in Europe, etc. I always wanted to live abroad and used to hear stories about “being a citizen of the world,” but I never thought it could really be possible.</p><p>Last year, I decided to raise my head and see what was happening outside of my comfort zone.</p><h3 id='making-the-decision'>Making the decision...</h3><p>I didn’t put much effort at the beginning, probably because of fear of failure, but things got serious when I received an offer to join a really nice company in Germany. Suddenly I found myself trying to take a decision.</p><p>Accepting this offer would mean relocating to another country, leaving everything behind, learning a new language, finding a new home, etc… To make things more complex, it would not only involve me, but would also affect my wife and our children’s lives.</p><p>We reviewed the pros and cons, we read expat blogs, and we asked friends of friends, but everyone had different experiences. At the end of the day, no one is going to make the decision for you, so we discussed as a family and we decided to do it -- one step at a time.</p><h3 id='preparing-for-the-move'>Preparing for the move...</h3><p>Things started to happen in a way that ended up making us believe it was our destiny.</p><p>I received the contract and we began collecting papers to apply for a work permit Visa. We thought we had plenty of time, but suddenly we found ourselves flying to Buenos Aires (where the German embassy is) because we found out the visa approval could take up to three months. Thankfully, a few weeks later we received an email saying that our visas were approved!</p><h3 id='the-biggest-challenge'>The biggest challenge...</h3><p>The next big step was to book our flights to Hamburg. The flight date was approaching really fast, and based on this date we booked a temporary apartment and confirmed the starting date with the company. Everything was ready... except the passports. After two weeks they were still “en route.”</p><p>A week before our flight, the embassy realized that they had misplaced our passports, so they sent them back “again.” That week was the longest of my life. We called the post office and waited for the postman every day. Finally, our passports arrived two days before flying!</p><h3 id='living-in-germany'>Living in Germany...</h3><p>Last week we reached the one month mark of living in Germany, and we couldn’t be happier about how things ended up happening.</p><p>Hamburg is an amazing city, with great and helpful people and we are really looking forward to discover what’s next.</p><p>This is just my experience. It could be similar or not to many other experiences out there, but one thing that’s always the same: try for yourself, don’t be afraid of the change and to meet new people. </p><p><em>The world is becoming a global village, and we all have the same opportunities.</em></p>",

When it comes to climate change, tech (and more specifically the developer community) provides some of our <a target='_blank' href='https://singularityhub.com/2019/05/13/12-ways-big-tech-can-take-big-action-on-climate-change/'>greatest hopes</a> for lessening humanity’s overall impact. </p><p>In preparation for the strike, we spoke with two Honeypot clients, <strong>tado°</strong> and <strong>Lana Labs</strong>, about their thoughts on tech and climate change. Environmental activism may not be the first thing that jumps to mind when you hear home heating or process mining--but perhaps it should be. These two forward-thinking companies show that there are many ways to use our modern tools to make a positive difference. Read on to find out how they do it! </p><br> <h2 id='home-climate-management'>Home Climate Management</h2><br><p align='center'><img alt='Company logo for tado° home heating and cooling.' src='/assets/images/tado_logo.jpg' style='width:50% !important;'></p><br><p><em>Interview with Paul Hughes, Head of PR &amp; Communications at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tado.com/en'>tado°</a></em> </p><br> <p><strong>Q: How would you describe tado° to someone who has never heard of you?</strong> *</p><p>A: tado° is dedicated to intelligent home climate management. <strong>Around 30% of global energy consumption is used for heating, cooling, and hot water of buildings, and in the future all buildings will be heated and cooled intelligently.</strong> We make Smart Thermostats for heating and cooling systems and focus on software and services to save you energy and improve your comfort at home. This means you can control your home and individual room temperatures from anywhere, anytime, through your smartphone.</p><br> <p><strong>Q: Can you explain how you are using software to ensure homes are intelligently heated?</strong> </p><p>A: tado° develops hardware and software, but the real focus and intelligence of our products lie in the software side of things. We have <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tado.com/en/thermostat-heating'>several features</a> that save our users energy by ensuring that the heating is turned down when the last person leaves home. tado° Smart Thermostats also save energy when open windows are detected and use algorithms to adapt to the weather and make use of sunshine and natural heat. You can even control tado° through your existing smart home devices and voice assistants. </p><br><p align='center'><img alt='A woman uses her smartphone to control her tado° Smart Thermostat.' src='/assets/images/tado_smartphone.jpeg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p><strong>Q: How do you see the future of technology when it comes to climate change action? What are you most excited for when you look at this future?</strong></p><p>A: The effects of climate change are being felt more than ever and this has helped to accelerate both the will and technological capabilities to live in a more sustainable world. There are many exciting technological developments that can make a real impact, and this is especially true in our field. Homes consume a huge amount of energy, with heating and hot water making up over three quarters of home energy use – and a big part of that is wasted. <strong>Smart Thermostats not only ensure that heat is never wasted; they can also increase the share of renewable energy use at home.</strong> How? Renewable energy is cheaper at the point when it is being generated, but it is expensive to store. What if we could give homeowners and residents the option to heat their homes when the wind blows and the sun shines. This would give residents cheaper energy, while increasing the amount of renewable energy that is used - a win-win for your wallet and the environment.</p><br> <p><strong>Q: What are your favorite resources for someone who is looking for ways to live a greener life?</strong></p><p>A: We try to encourage the philosophy that everyone can make a difference, that we don’t have to rely on others. <strong>There are innumerable resources out there; find out where you are consuming the most energy, and producing the most CO2, and think about what you can realistically do about it – this doesn’t necessarily have to come at the expense of your comfort or convenience.</strong> Today it can be easy to be smarter about your energy use, while recycling, taking more public transport/cycling, or cutting down on meat and dairy are within the grasp of most people. </p><br> <h2 id='penguins-and-process-mining'>Penguins and Process Mining</h2><br><p align='center'><img alt='Company logo for Lana Labs process mining: a green penguin silhouette.' src='/assets/images/lana_labs.png' style='width:50% !important;'></p><br><p><em>Interview with Jonny Ehrich - Marketing &amp; Content Manager at <a target='_blank' href='https://lanalabs.com/en'>Lana Labs</a></em></p><br> <p><strong>Q: How would you describe Lana Labs to someone who has never heard of you?</strong></p><p>A: We are a software company focused on making businesses more efficient and productive. Our tool LANA uses <em>process mining</em> to translate the data stored in a company’s IT systems into actionable insights into their business processes. We use process mining to make business process (like production and procurement) transparent, which gives companies a fact-based foundation for sustainable improvements and optimization measures. The end results are better resource efficiency and improved performance.</p><br> <p><strong>Q: Can you walk me through the connection between process mining and environmentalism?</strong> </p><p>A: It is true, the connection between optimizing business processes and saving the environment might not be apparent on first glance, but by using our product, businesses can cut down on unnecessary rework, resource-consuming process loops, and delays due to factors like logistical issues. </p><p><em>An example:</em> A manufacturing company notices that they experience a high amount of delays and additional rework in their main production process. They analyze the process with LANA and find out: 90% of items that needed additional modification went through one specific workstation. With this knowledge, the company now optimizes the identified root cause of the problem (such as a faulty machine). <em>The result:</em> not only is the production faster and more cost-efficient, the company also saves a huge amount of other resources (manpower, energy, materials).</p><p>Bottom line, the company made their process more sustainable. <strong>Resource efficiency isn’t just crucial for business, it has a direct impact on the environment as well – the less energy, time and materials a company has to put into their process, the smaller their impact on the environment.</strong></p><br><p align='center'><img alt='A colony of Magellanic penguins walk together in southern Chile.' src='/assets/images/penguins.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p><strong>Q: You have become the biggest supporter of the Magellanic penguin colony in southern Chile… why this bird? Where did the decision to support these penguins come from?</strong> </p><p>A: We all have to choose our battles, a single company cannot save the environment on its own. For us, the focus fell on <a target='_blank' href='https://lanalabs.com/en/penguins/'>saving penguins</a>. </p><p>It was very important for us to take a stand and actively support environmental protection efforts. The fact that we focus on the Magellanic penguin in particular originally came about through our founders&#39; personal fondness for those animals – the penguin even made it into our company logo, after all. Since then, it has grown into something bigger.</p><p>With every new software license sold and every new employee at Lana Labs, we adopt a penguin in our colony in Southern Chile. <strong>With this, we want to bridge the perceived gap between an abstract field such as data analysis, and our impact on the real world.</strong> The penguin has become a symbol for our focus on sustainability. That is why we use the tagline: improve the world, one process at a time.</p><br> <p><strong>Q: How do you see the role of technology in the global fight against climate change? What are you most excited about when you look at the future of technology and climate change action?</strong></p><p>A: It is great to see so many companies, big and small, step up to actively fight climate change. In the past, most technological innovations came to the detriment of the environment (from early industrialization to the adoption of nuclear power without a solution for nuclear waste disposal). It is inspiring to see that slowly, this is being turned on its head – many of our current technological breakthroughs have the specific goal of saving the environment, not exploiting it. </p><p><strong>This awareness is one of the biggest driving factors in our fight against climate change.</strong> Individual actions on a personal level are a great start, whether that’s cutting down on your meat consumption or taking the bike to work, but meaningful change on a global scale has to happen on a much higher level. We can only hope that the work that’s being done by innovative thought leaders in our field acts as a beacon to the big players, from corporations to national governments.</p><br> <h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><p>From individual changes to large-scale undertakings, tech is already tackling some of the biggest environmental issues of our time. Companies like <strong>tado°</strong> and <strong>Lana Labs</strong> are clear examples that environmentally-minded companies can combat both the causes and the effects of climate change with technology. </p><p>So can tech stop climate change? We believe it can, and it’s up to all of us to make sure there is sufficient will to support the advancements being made (and those still to come). </p><p><strong>We hope you’ll join us--wherever you are--for the <a target='_blank' href='https://globalclimatestrike.net'>Global Climate Strike</a> on Friday, September 20!</strong></p>",

In fact, <strong>most of today’s successful programmers are self-taught</strong> while others participated in a coding boot camp that fast-tracked their learning process. </p><p>Programming and coding change rapidly – new programming languages and coding tricks emerge almost every day. The programming tricks you’re learning now will perhaps be slightly different before you even start practising your craft. For this reason, speed is an important factor when it comes to becoming a successful developer. <strong>Here are five tips to help you learn programming faster</strong> and start your career as soon as possible. </p><h3 id='1----define-your-purpose'>1.    Define your purpose</h3><p>Before you embark on the process of learning programming, you must come up with a clear reason for why you want to master this craft. Are you looking to develop apps in the future? Do you want to sharpen your current skills to get a promotion or land a better-paying job? <strong>Once you define your purpose, it’ll be easier for you to pick a good strategy for learning how to code</strong>. </p><p>If you want to develop apps or games once you become confident in your skills, then you should find out which programming languages are widely used in these sectors. While on this road, make sure to <a target='_blank' href='https://anonymster.com/'>secure your privacy</a> because as a newbie you may be a target for malicious attacks. Once you do this, you can identify areas that you need to focus on to achieve your goals. </p><h3 id='2----mine-the-gold-in-free-online-courses'>2.    Mine the gold in free online courses</h3><p>You don’t have to spend all your savings on learning programming. Although there are many online college courses tailored for new programmers, there are tons of free beginner-friendly tools and tutorials as well. Sites like <a target='_blank' href='https://programminghub.io/'>Programming Hub</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.udemy.com/'>Udemy</a> offer many easy-to-understand lessons that can help you learn the basics of programming. </p><p><strong>Raspberry Pi has become the most widely used micro-computer among beginner programmers and expert programmers alike</strong>. Getting your hands on this affordable and powerful micro-computer will help you learn programming quickly because it provides tons of learning opportunities. Who needs Alexa when you can program your own smart TV device or a tool that starts brewing your coffee in the morning? A great deal of <a target='_blank' href='https://vilros.com/'>Raspberry Pi</a> operating systems feature excellent development tools that you can use to learn and sharpen your programming skills. </p><h3 id='3----start-with-the-basics'>3.    Start with the basics</h3><p>Even if you already have some basic knowledge of programming under your belt, don’t fall into the trap of skipping the basic steps and diving straight to the advanced concepts. Instead, start with the elementary steps so that you can build a strong foundation for your programming knowledge. Some of these steps include an understanding of: </p><ul><li>Programming environment</li><li>Variables</li><li>Operators</li><li>Data types and structures</li></ul><p>You should always keep on <a target='_blank' href='https://www.guru99.com/computer-programming-tutorial.html'>reviewing these basics</a> even as you keep learning. If you bypass the first stages of these, there are high chances that you’ll struggle or even get stuck when you start learning the more complex concepts. </p><h3 id='4----look-for-coding-games-to-play'>4.    Look for coding games to play</h3><p>Introducing a little bit of fun into the process of learning programming is a smart move. If all you do every day is look at a coding book, you’re likely to get bored. Fortunately, there are many online sites like <a target='_blank' href='https://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a> that provide fun-packed games designed for programmers.</p><p><strong>By injecting some fun in the learning process, you can master more coding skills faster without getting bored</strong>. With so many coding games out there, you’ll need to do some research to identify those that’ll suit your needs. Remember, these games come in different levels, so be sure to choose games that match your skills. </p><h3 id='5----keep-practising-and-ask-for-help-when-necessary'>5.    Keep practising and ask for help when necessary</h3><p><strong>If you want to learn to code faster and become an excellent programmer, then you must be willing to invest countless hours and lots of effort into it</strong>. Ensure you have enough software and the correct coding tools so that you can write error-free code. </p><p>Get a professional programmer who is active in the industry to guide you in charting your way as the go-to programmer. A competent coding expert will help you when you get stuck or you’re having difficulty understanding a certain concept. </p><h2 id='a-step-at-a-time'>A step at a time</h2><p>Learning programming is not an overnight thing. It takes time, effort, and most importantly, willingness to learn. <strong>To speed up the learning process, you need to remain motivated and positive</strong>. Mistakes are bound to happen, but that doesn’t mean you give up. Instead, it means you learn from them and work towards becoming a better programmer. </p><hr><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up'>Join Honeypot</a> today and receive 4 interview invites or more in three weeks.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p>As recruiters, we’ve all experienced the heartbreak of a newly hired employee leaving after only a short time. Sometimes we’re left wondering what happened, and other times it’s quite clear, but the resulting frustrations are almost always the same. As we scramble to restart the hiring process and find a replacement, we often ask ourselves: is there something we could have done differently?  </p><p>For the European tech industry, finding and retaining talent from abroad has become one of the most pressing issues of the day. A <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bitkom.org/Presse/Presseinformation/Erstmals-mehr-100000-unbesetzte-Stellen-fuer-IT-Experten'>recently published study</a> put the current number of unfilled IT vacancies in Germany at 124,000 (up from 82,000 last year). This demand cannot be filled solely with European engineers, so recruiters must look increasingly to skilled developers outside the EU. </p><p>Honeypot helps companies connect with software developers from all over the world looking for their dream job in Europe, and this year the Honeypot Relocation team has helped to relocate over 60 developers. So how do we, as companies, make sure that the candidates we put time and effort into hiring actually stick around? </p><h2 id='1-fly-them-in'>1. Fly them in</h2><p>It’s important to start your retention strategy even before an offer has been made. One of the best ways to ensure that your new hire will be happy in their new city is to bring them there! Flying a candidate in for an in-person interview allows them the chance to not only experience your company culture in person, but also to experience life in their potential new home. It’s a great way to make sure they love it before making the final commitment. </p><p>We recommend flying in not only the candidate but <em>the whole family</em> whenever possible. As you’ll see below, buy-in from the family is critically important in ensuring that your new hire sticks around. The investment you make by bringing them in - especially for high level positions - will pay off when your new hire not only accepts your offer, but contributes to your success for years to come.</p><p>Once you’ve made your decision and extended an offer, what other barriers can you remove for your new hire? </p><h2 id='2-offer-travel-assistance'>2. Offer travel assistance</h2><p>Helping with the headache of travel can be a huge relief! Many companies choose to book flights on behalf of their new employees, removing not only logistical but also financial hurdles.</p><p>Something as simple as checking details about the flight can ease so much of the stress related to moving. Are they travelling with family and need seats together? How much baggage do they need to check in? What about dietary restrictions, or extra leg room? Be sure to check each of these details in advance. </p><p>These are things new hires are often too busy to think of but appreciate immensely. The upfront cost is well worth it to create a great first experience. </p><h2 id='3-help-with-their-housing'>3. Help with their housing</h2><p>The <a target='_blank' href='http://blog.honeypot.io/15-tips-finding-a-flat-berlin/'>housing situation in Berlin</a> is undoubtedly tricky. Demand is high (and getting higher every day), and supply is constrained by building permits and city ordinances. </p><p>For tech talents relocating to Germany, the difficulty of finding an apartment in the first place is compounded by the fact that many available apartments are offered unfurnished. This is especially tough for those coming to Germany with a limited number of belongings. On the other end of the spectrum, however, moving with furniture also presents its own challenges such as shipping and storage.</p><p>For this reason, it’s important to take into account each employee’s individual needs to find the best initial housing solution: </p><ul><li>Is it a single person or a family? </li><li>Are they shipping furniture or arriving with only a suitcase? </li><li>Will there be children or pets accompanying them? </li></ul><p>You may choose to set up an apartment building (owned by the company) that can house several new employees for a short period. For those not able to take advantage of this option, there is also the option to partner with local realtors to help find furnished short-term accommodations. This allows the new employee to settle in to their new city for a month or two while looking for a more permanent solution. </p><p>Bonus tip: Provide your new employees with information on resources such as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/'>eBay Kleinanzeigen</a> where newly arrived employees can find discounted furniture to fill a new apartment.</p><h2 id='4-support-their-partner'>4. Support their partner</h2><p>The single biggest issue that international talents cite as a reason for leaving a new job (and sometimes leaving the country entirely) is an unhappy partner. The partner with a new job has somewhere exciting to go to every day, is constantly meeting new colleagues, and has a chance to get to know the new city. Meanwhile, the partner on a family reunification visa may be sitting at home feeling isolated in an unfamiliar new country where they don’t speak the language.  </p><p>Companies can do a lot to ensure that talents stay with them by making an effort to support the entire family. This includes (but is of course not limited to): </p><ul><li><p><strong>Inviting the spouse to come along for the final interview in Berlin.</strong> As we discussed above, It’s important that both partners have a chance to see the new city and explore what the move will mean for each of their lives. If both partners are prepared for and happy with the move, it’s much more likely that your new hire will stay in town. </p></li><li><p><strong>Assisting the spouse with their job search.</strong> For most families these days, two incomes is no longer a luxury but rather a requirement. This is especially true in a new city where a family can incur additional expenses in the process of settling in. Apart from the monetary value, finding a job in a new city can also provide a sense of purpose and motivation, and a way to meet new people in an unfamiliar place. </p></li><li><p><strong>Invite the spouse to company events.</strong> Especially for partners who have not yet found a job in the new city, moving to a new country can be an isolating experience. Extending an invitation to join company events and networking opportunities allows partners to feel included in your new hire’s excitement, and provides an essential tie to the new city that will help your new hire put down roots. </p></li></ul><h2 id='5-consider-their-children'>5. Consider their children</h2><p>Finding a daycare for little ones presents yet another challenge for recently relocated families. Kita (short for <a target='_blank' href='https://www.german-way.com/history-and-culture/education/the-german-school-system/'>Kindertagesstätte</a> is the German system of daycare for children ages 3 to 5. It’s an invaluable aid to families with young children, allowing both parents to work and to leave the house during the day - an essential part of integrating into a new culture. </p><p>In Berlin in particular, and in many other German cities, Kita can be nearly as competitive as finding a university! In fact, many families begin their Kita search as soon as they learn they are expecting. The situation varies from district to district, but in Berlin it is especially difficult in trendy and young districts such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte. </p><p>Companies can go a long way in supporting newly arrived families by assisting with Kita search and providing guidance on options. In particular, finding suitable housing for young families can allow them better access to Kita programs in their neighborhood. It’s also helpful to make sure that families are aware of their legal rights and options when it comes to Kita. </p><h2 id='6-help-them-with-their-pets'>6. Help them with their pets</h2><p>Although less common than travelling with a partner and children, many people moving abroad also bring beloved pets to their new city. In these cases, it’s helpful to provide as much information as possible in advance to make sure this transition is a smooth one: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Candidates should be aware in advance of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/travel-safely-your-pet-car-airplane-ship-or-train'>how animals travel on planes</a>, as well as the risk they are taking by transporting their pets this way.</strong> Such a journey can be stressful for pets and in some cases can cause lasting traumas. Depending on the type of animal, there are various steps that can be taken to minimize dangers and keep your pet as comfortable as possible to ensure everyone arrives safely. </p></li><li><p><strong>Candidates should also be well informed of what life will be like <a target='_blank' href='https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/life-with-pets-in-germany-what-you-need-to-know/'>owning a pet in Germany</a>.</strong> What are the regulations for registering a pet? Where is the closest emergency veterinarian? In many cities there is also a pet tax for certain breeds. As an employer, informing your new hire about these regulations in advance can help avoid unwanted surprises later on. </p></li></ul><h2 id='7-go-the-extra-mile'>7. Go the extra mile</h2><p>There are a few areas where you can really go above and beyond to make your new hire feel at home in their new city.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Does your new hire have furniture or other household items to ship?</strong> Why not take one more thing off their plate by providing a list of shipping companies that you know are reputable? You can also recommend a good storage facility to house their belongings while they look for a permanent home. </p></li><li><p><strong>Help them to up a bank account once they arrive so there is no delay when it comes to the first paycheck.</strong> Several banks offer online banking and allow you to withdraw cash at local ATMs without fees. Some also offer a convenient local branch or English-speaking service. </p></li><li><p><strong>Designate a German-speaking colleague to help out when small things come up.</strong> This is often as simple as helping your new hire to read a letter they’ve received from their health insurance or landlord, or helping to book an appointment over the phone. </p></li></ul><h2 id='8-use-the-buddy-system'>8. Use the Buddy System</h2><p>One of the best ways that you can support an international talent’s move to Germany is to put them in contact with another employee who has moved from abroad. They can share stories and support each other in their adventures. At Honeypot, we use the “buddy system,” assigning each new Honeypotter a “buddy” who is responsible for showing them around the office, introducing them to their new colleagues, answering questions, and checking in periodically to make sure they are happy.</p><p><em>Is this your first international hire? Let us know and Honeypot can help you put your new employee in touch with someone who has already made the leap at a similar company!</em></p><h2 id='takeaways'>Takeaways</h2><p>Investing a bit of time and energy into refining your onboarding process is key to making sure the talent you hire from abroad sticks around long-term. Even before an offer has been made, there are steps you can take to ensure that potential new employees will be happy in their new city, and that the entire family is onboard with the move. From the travel plans to the first days in their new home, it is critical to anticipate any potential needs and make the move as smooth and as painless as possible. </p><p>As German tech companies prepare to welcome international developers in ever-increasing numbers, we hope these tips will help you to create a lasting impression for your next hires. </p><p>Want to learn more about hiring internationally?

Here&#39;s part one: <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/source-screen-developers-remotely/'>How to Source and Screen Developers Remotely</a> and part three: <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/onboard-developers-remotely/'>How to Onboard Developers Remotely</a></em></p><br /><p>You had your interview process down. Your candidate experience was stellar. Glassdoor was packed with positive reviews, your inbox overflowed with candidate emails thanking you for the smooth experience. <strong>But then COVID-19 hit, and your company, like many others, adopted an indefinite work-from-home policy</strong>.  No more face-to-face interviews, no more onsite days, no more get-to-know-the-team-lunches. </p><p>In this new remote world, <strong>how can you maintain your recruiting standards</strong> while still providing a positive and friendly candidate experience for developers in your pipeline? </p><p>The good news is many Honeypot clients are already happily doing full interview and selection processes with developers remotely. We gathered these 11 simple tips. </p><br /><h2 id='preparing-for-the-interview'>Preparing for the interview:</h2><h3 id='1-check-your-tech'>1. Check your tech</h3><p>There are few things worse than having your tech fail you during an interview. To avoid it, here are a few things to do in preparation for your upcoming remote interview:</p><ul><li><strong>Download the latest version</strong>: If you’re using Zoom, Lifesize, or a similar program, make sure your candidate knows beforehand to download the app (it is often more reliable than the browser version). </li><li><strong>Send contact details in advance</strong>: Whether it’s a Skype username, a Hangout link or a Zoom conference room, make it clear in advance how the candidate should reach you.  </li><li><strong>Check your camera, audio and microphone</strong>: you can usually test in the application, but if you want to be extra careful, test with a colleague.</li><li><strong>Battery Power</strong>: Make sure you have sufficient battery! </li><li><strong>Ask for a phone number</strong>: before the interview, ask for the phone number of the candidate. If your tech really does fail, this is important to have! </li></ul><p>Heck, if you want to be trip safe, just go ahead and restart your whole computer. All programs will reopen fresh, limiting chances of a crash during the call. Although a crash is unlikely anyway… you just never know. </p><h3 id='2-mute-your-notifications'>2. Mute your notifications</h3><p>Snooze your Slack notifications and pause your email alerts as they’re distracting for both you and the candidate. How many times have you been in a situation where that ** IMPORTANT ** email alert comes through in the top right of your screen, and your sentence trails off or you stop listening to the other person for just a moment, only to come back a second later and mumble an apology? Just me? Anyway, I can’t stress this one enough. Snooze everything.</p><h3 id='3-create-a-clutter-noise-and-distraction-free-environment'>3. Create a clutter, noise and distraction-free environment</h3><p>Since you’ll likely be conducting the interview from home too, then this point is especially important.</p><p>Basically, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY'>don’t be this guy</a>.</p><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Interrupted Interview' src='/assets/images/interview-interrupt.png' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><h3 id='4-set-up-your-video-frame'>4. Set-up your video frame</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of people make is putting light directly behind them during video calls, like sitting with their back towards a window. This blows out the background and turns you into a silhouette. No one can see you! So make sure you light from in front, not from behind. Do this with the natural light through a window or a lamp.</p><br /><p align='center'><img alt='Don't do this' src='/assets/images/Caleb-backlit.png' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>Also be sure to position yourself correctly too - your head and shoulders should be showing; you don’t want any full-face, seeing-up-your-nose action. </p><p align='center'><img alt='Set it up like this' src='/assets/images/cameratips.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-videoconference-how-to-use-a-standing-desk/'>Wired</a></p><h3 id='5-prepare-your-script'>5. Prepare your script</h3><p>You’ve done about a million interviews before, so you probably have the process down, but one benefit of conducting remote interviews is that <strong>you can have your questions right there on the computer screen</strong> and read them as you go. </p><p>If you haven’t done that before, the process is pretty simple. Give this a try: </p><ul><li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key and left or right arrow, followed by the up or down arrow. </li><li>Then do the same with a second <strong>window</strong> on the same side and you will have two snapped into place. </li></ul><p>And for Mac:</p><ul><li>Click and hold the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window. </li><li>Hold down on the button until it shrinks and drag over to the left or the right of your screen.</li><li>Release the button, then click a window on the other side of the screen to begin using both windows side by side.</li></ul><p>Your screen should be split now, and you can see the candidate and your questions at the same time. </p><br /><h2 id='conducting-the-interview'>Conducting the interview</h2><p>Most things will look quite similar to a face-to-face interview. You’ll ask the same questions, and you’ll want the same outcomes, but the medium is different and <strong>there are a couple of things that are essential to keep in mind while conducting a video interview</strong>. </p><h3 id='1-build-trust-with-your-candidate'>1. Build trust with your candidate</h3><p>This is something that is much easier to do face-to-face, but <strong>building trust and rapport with the interviewee is not impossible via video</strong>! It does, however, take a little more work. </p><p>Start as you usually would by making sure the candidate is comfortable. Do they have water or a coffee? Then try a little bit of a conversation. Ask the candidate how they’re doing, be willing to be a little vulnerable about how you’re doing yourself. <strong>It&#39;s your job to make them feel at ease!</strong> </p><p>Finally, don’t forget to introduce yourself. Tell them who you are, where in the company you work and set expectations: what are you hoping to get out of this call? It’s a very simple step but one that can be overlooked when your mind is going in a million different directions. It also helps to ease the candidate into the call - <strong>they’re probably feeling a little nervous</strong>, too. </p><h3 id='2-make-your-expressions-clear'>2. Make your expressions clear</h3><p>The candidate can’t read your body language - this is why it’s especially important to <strong>let the candidate know how you’re feeling through facial expressions</strong>. Smile and nod, give a thumbs up here and there, and make these expressions a little bit bigger than you usually would if face-to-face. You don’t want the candidate to think your video has frozen, which can tend to happen when you’re listening intently. Be sure to listen actively, too. </p><h3 id='3-give-space-and-time-for-video-lag'>3. Give space and time for video lag</h3><p>This one is a common problem. How often have you been in a video conference call where you’ve been cut off by the other person, barely having finished your thought? What we often forget is that conversation can’t flow in the same way with video conferencing software; there can’t be the jousting of thoughts and words, interjecting isn’t so easy anymore, and it all feels quite unnatural. Keeping this in mind, <strong>ensure that you wait a moment when you think the candidate has finished speaking</strong>. This allows for the lag to catch up, and you can be assured that you won’t be cutting them off. Hopefully they’ve had the foresight to think about the same thing with you - you’ll know if they’re interrupting you or if it’s an honest mistake. </p><h3 id='4-dealing-with-a-poor-connection'>4. Dealing with a poor connection</h3><p>Maybe this is on their side, or maybe it’s on yours. Be prepared for the possibility either way. This is another opportunity to show some agility and there are potential solutions. Perhaps the video is lagging too much where you are unable to see the candidate, or their audio is often cutting out. Offer to switch the interview to audio only and shut off the cameras. This can help a great deal.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s useful to ask the candidate for their email prior to the interview starting</strong>. If the connection cuts or is too poor to communicate, give them a ring. If you don’t have a company phone already, ask for one - or if not, some support with paying your data plan! </p><p>If it’s really unmanageable, offer to reschedule. Try to do so directly on the call or via a chat to make sure the candidate still has a clear and quick experience! </p><h3 id='5-give-the-candidate-breaks-during-back-to-back-interviews'>5. Give the candidate breaks during back-to-back interviews</h3><p>Just as you would for on-site interviews, if you’ve allotted a couple of hours for a candidate to be interviewing in your office, you’ve probably allocated some time for them to have a drink or bathroom break. Allow them the same opportunity during back-to-back video interviews. <strong>It’s equally important for the candidate to recharge their mind and come to each interview refreshed</strong> and ready to continue. It’s also easy to forget in the virtual world. </p><h3 id='6-prepare-when-interviewing-with-colleagues'>6. Prepare when interviewing with colleagues</h3><p>Trying to navigate a remote interview alone is one thing, but what do you do when there are other colleagues in the call? There are few worse things in an interview than the interviewee being unprepared. There are things you can do to ensure that you don’t give this impression: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Coordinate with your hiring manager</strong>: The person scheduling and coordinating the interviews should send an overview to all interviewers about the plan for the candidate. That gives you a chance to know in which sequence you are interviewing.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Sync with your interview partner</strong>: have a quick call or chat with your interviewing partner before the call. Sounds simple, but you’d be surprised by how often people just roll into interviews to ‘wing’ it. We’re all busy! It happens! Before the interview talk about what you both want to get out of the interview and who takes which topics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decide who is closing</strong>: Decide who should close the call - make sure to give an opportunity for a final question before saying goodbye to the candidate. </p></li></ul><h3 id='7-ask-the-right-questions'>7. Ask the right questions</h3><p>Although they might not be a remote employee forever, they might be for the first little while, and so there are some extra qualities you should be looking for. <strong>You might want to know just how independent they are, what their communication is like, what motivates them</strong>, and so on. Some examples of questions you can ask to get this information include:</p><ul><li>What motivates you?</li><li>What tools have you used in the past for communication? </li><li>What do you think your biggest challenge will be while working remotely, and how do you expect to overcome it?</li><li>How do you process information?</li><li>If you had a problem, but no one else on the team was online or available, how would you handle it?</li></ul><h3 id='8-let-them-know-next-steps'>8. Let them know next steps</h3><p>This step is another one you would do on-site, but is easily forgotten when interviewing online. Let the candidate know the next steps: who will be in touch, and when? Thank them for taking the time and let them ask any questions they might have! </p><br /><h2 id='after-the-interview'>After the interview</h2><h3 id='write-down-your-notes-right-away'>Write down your notes right away</h3><p>This is a huge benefit of video interviews. During on-site interviews, you would usually have to say goodbye to the candidate and walk them out - maybe even show them through your office. Important details from the interview can slip your mind, but <strong>with video interviews, you can hang up the call and input your feedback right away</strong>. That’s ‘interview best practices’ 101!</p><br /><h2 id='what-about-technical-interviews'>What about technical interviews?</h2><p>The technical interview for developers takes quite a different approach. Your average interview is very straightforward - have a chat, make some notes, make your decision - you’re done! Though when hiring developers, the process can often be lengthier and more… robust, let’s say. But it’s not too tricky to also conduct these remotely - their whole job is computer-based anyway.</p><h4 id='consider-limiting-your-technical-interviews-to-the-asynchronous-kind'>Consider limiting your technical interviews to the asynchronous kind.</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Take-home code challenge</strong>: They submit the code within a given timeframe with documentation to show their thought processes. Discuss it further in a call afterwards. </p></li><li><p><strong>Pair programming</strong>: this is another take-home challenge, except that they do it with another colleague - also in a given timeframe. This way the candidate can ask questions, both they and the current employee can assess how they would work together, and it can easily be done via a screen. Use some coding interview programs such as <a target='_blank' href='http://codepen.io'>Codepen</a> or <a target='_blank' href='http://codeshare.io'>Codeshare</a>. We use Hackerrank’s <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hackerrank.com/products/codepair/'>Codepair</a> at Honeypot.</p></li></ul><br /><h2 id='takeaways'>Takeaways</h2><p>Many Honeypot clients already conduct large chunks of the interview process remotely. In fact, many companies, particularly those hiring international talent, do everything online. <strong>Applying common sense in preparing your work-area, looking after the applicant and communicating with your colleagues</strong>, are often the small details which make the difference for the candidate. </p><p>Remote interviewing doesn’t have to feel like a burden or a stop-gap measure. <strong>Developers love efficient processes, clear workflows and generally appreciate remote work</strong>. So take the time to evaluate your remote candidate experience, make the changes necessary and get hiring. You could actually end up making a permanent change for the better! </p><br /><p>Read Part 3 of our Guide to Hiring Developers Remotely: <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/onboard-developers-remotely/'><strong>How to Onboard Developers Remotely</strong></a></p>",

Jumping into this new reality means rethinking recruiting practices to remain agile. When it comes to sourcing and screening for tech positions you’re going to want to be on your A-game. </p><p>We’ve created this handy guide to amplify your strategies to remotely source and screen developers. Sourcing and screening largely happen remotely anyway, so take the time now to explore new channels and brush up on some best practices.  </p><br /><h2 id='11--sourcing-software-engineer-candidates'>1.1  Sourcing software engineer candidates</h2><p>As a recruiter, you will spend the majority of your time sourcing, screening and interviewing candidates. It’s important that your process is streamlined since it’ll likely be the first experience a candidate has with your company. <strong>How you handle the candidates in these processes could have a direct impact on your brand’s public perception</strong> - you should always assume the experience you create will end up on an employer review website such as <a target='_blank' href='http://www.glassdoor.de'>Glassdoor</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kununu.com/'>Kununu</a>. </p><p>Aside from building brand reputation, your sourcing strategy should help you reduce the time spent filling an open position in your company. <strong>The average time of an open IT position within a company is five-and-a-half months</strong>. Openings which drag on like this have been estimated to cost the average business a net loss of around <a target='_blank' href='https://insights.dice.com/employer-resource-center/calculating-the-cost-of-vacant-tech-positions/'>€450 per day</a>. You can see why it’s important to fill these positions as quickly as possible. And a few more reasons why sourcing is crucial (if you’re still not convinced).  </p><h4 id='benefits-of-proper-sourcing-techniques'>Benefits of proper sourcing techniques:</h4><ul><li>Find better-suited candidates</li><li>Reduce time spent screening and interviewing</li><li>Attract a larger pool of candidates</li><li>Faster hires</li><li>Lower cost-per-hire</li></ul><br /><h2 id='5-ways-to-effectively-source-software-developers'>5 ways to effectively source software developers</h2><h3 id='1--create-a-candidate-profile'>1 . Create a candidate profile</h3><p>The problem a lot of companies face when sourcing software engineers is that <strong>they fail to specify exactly what they are looking for in the candidate</strong>, and so either aim too small or too big. There are a number of reasons for this; it could be that the engineering team lead has failed to communicate exactly what they are looking for in a candidate, or the recruiter lacks the specific technical knowledge to grasp the nuances of the position. <strong>This mistake is easily avoided by creating a strong and clear candidate profile before the search even begins</strong>. This will help target your position to the right group of job seekers, and equip you with a standard to measure applicants against. </p><h4 id='how-to-build-a-software-engineer-candidate-profile'>How to build a software engineer candidate profile:</h4><ul><li>Narrow-down to one main technology (e.g. Java, PHP)</li><li>Identify required frameworks (e.g. Spring, Laravel)</li><li>Identify the main technology, if only frameworks/tools are mentioned (e.g. Wordpress)</li><li>Understand what the job entails (e.g. developing web applications, maintaining platforms, DevOps, developing architecture)</li><li>Check for any other specific requirements (local language, years of experience) (e.g. Dutch)</li><li>Industry experience relevancy</li><li>Lead experience necessity</li></ul><p>A job posting is likely to get 100+ applicants, and you don’t have time to wade through the onslaught of resumes to find the person you are looking for. Specifying exactly what you want will help you filter down to an amount that can be handled in a more timely manner. </p><h3 id='2-post-a-job-advertisement'>2. Post a job advertisement</h3><p>Whether you are posting a job advertisement on job boards or talking to candidates directly on Honeypot, it’s important to be specific and clear about what you are looking for. <strong>The job description is going to be the first introduction to potential candidates</strong>, so put your best foot forward. </p><p>Ideally, you want to present your company in an honest and positive way. We often see companies trying to break the mould with confusing titles like ‘full-stack ninja’ or ‘front-end wizard’. Please don’t do that. People can see through it and it’ll only turn away your most qualified professionals and make you look out-of-touch. Also, titles with ‘wizard or rockstar’ in them are not easily searchable on the web, which means less people are likely to spot them. </p><p>If you don’t know how to write a proper job post, there are a bunch of resources out there, but just in case, we’ve listed the most important points to consider below. </p><h4 id='tips-for-writing-a-job-posting'>Tips for writing a job posting:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Keep it concise</strong> - Get to the point, don’t add anything that isn’t necessary to the job posting, and keep it realistic. When talking about your company’s history/values, keep it punctual and intriguing, we don’t want to hear your life’s story.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design</strong> - Save your post from looking like a messy tangle of words by ordering it in sections with headers and using consistent formatting throughout. </p></li><li><p><strong>Length</strong> - Your post should have just enough information to answer all of the important questions regarding the role and who is advertising it. Don’t overwhelm the candidate with pages and pages of definitions and bullet points, people are lazy and when confronted with giant walls of text tend to eject. </p></li><li><p><strong>Tone &amp; brand</strong> - The tone you employ in the post should be in line with your brand. Talk about the benefits of the role and the values of the company - job seekers most often look for companies that align with their values. And no, ‘free tea bags’ is not a benefit worth mentioning! </p></li><li><p><strong>Inclusive language</strong> - The job seekers reading your post will share a number of different backgrounds, nationalities and genders. Think about those people when creating the ad, and try to utilise inclusive language to capture a diverse audience.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid corporate speak</strong> - It’s a huge turn-off for the young folk! Sure, you may be representing a fintech company and want to be taken seriously - totally understandable. There are ways to do this without using rigid acronyms and boring language.</p></li></ul><h3 id='3-utilise-your-personal-network'>3. Utilise your personal network</h3><p>Another way to source potential candidates remotely is through your company’s network. Inbound interest will most probably reveal your strongest leads. <strong>The applicants who are responding directly through your website will be familiar with your brand and have a high interest in working for you</strong>. So make sure you are posting to your website and local channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, Xing, Facebook, etc.).</p><p>Many recruiters also use LinkedIn and Xing to source potential candidates - it’s a great way to connect with talents already in your ecosystem. You can easily check profiles and see if they have the relevant skills and if they are open to new opportunities.</p><p>Software engineers and tech professionals get bombarded daily with invitations and offers of all kinds. The overuse of these mediums has significantly reduced lead quality and response rates. We often hear developers complaining about spam messages and irrelevant offers, keep that in mind when reaching out to software engineers on these platforms. </p><h3 id='4-join-chat-rooms-and-online-communities'>4. Join chat rooms and online communities</h3><p>Working from home or in another city means you won’t be able to connect with local talent at events and meetups. Thankfully, there are a bunch of places online where you can network and source qualified talent without stepping foot outside your home. </p><p>Actually, without having to be there in person, <strong>you can get far more involved in the community then if you were travelling from event to event</strong> (and you’ll save a ton of time). There are online conferences with active chat rooms, online developer meetups, and plenty of active developer forums. These online spaces are going to be great for sourcing talent for hard to fill positions. </p><p>Don’t barge into these spaces with guns ablazing, asking every user if they would like to interview at your company. <strong>Take a curious approach by asking questions and getting to know the people there</strong>. The more involved you are in these tech communities the more trusted you’ll be when asking for a qualified lead. </p><h3 id='5-use-honeypot'>5. Use Honeypot</h3><p>Honeypot is a platform which allows you to quickly and easily source qualified tech professionals. With local and international candidates all in one place, you won’t have to scour the internet or send out a billion DMs to get a solid lead. <strong>Candidates on Honeypot are actively looking for new tech roles</strong>, meaning you won’t be wasting your time sending messages to passive opportunists. </p><p>The platform is a great way to source talent from across the globe; with boolean search, responsive filtering options, and 85% talent response rates, you can fill your pipeline with pre-screened candidates and build your team quicker compared with other channels. 80% of the companies searching on the platform hire within 4 weeks. </p><p>Candidates are verified through a code challenge and a call with our Talent Success team, <strong>meaning less time wasted for technical hiring managers</strong>. If you’re not familiar with the platform, here’s a quick rundown of how to use the Honeypot platform.</p><h4 id='steps-for-finding-qualified-talent-using-honeypot'>Steps for finding qualified talent using Honeypot:</h4><ul><li><p>Optimise your company profile; fill in each section, add some team photos - ensure you’re giving a great first impression. Talents will use the profile pages to learn more about you and your company, so make sure your company’s personality and brand shine through! </p></li><li><p>Start with a more broad search and keeping in mind the people who may use different wording or terminology. </p></li><li><p>Start narrowing by years of experience and role.</p></li><li><p>If you are familiar with <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/product-update-hello-boolean-search/'>Boolean search</a> you will want to add required tech-stacks and skills to refine candidates further.</p></li><li><p>Ideally you want to filter down to between 5-20 talents. If the group is larger, narrow further by selecting some nice-to-have skills. </p></li><li><p>At this point you’ll have a handful of quality matches, but before you jump to an interview invitation, you’re going to want to read through their personal profiles to get a better understanding of who the candidate is. Check their interests and industry experience. Here, you will also be able to read the notes from a Talent Success Adviser, who’s there to give honest feedback on the candidate from a pre-screening video call. </p></li><li><p>Once you are confident with the search matches, you can go ahead and use the messaging system to send out an interview invitation. We advise you use personalised messages as these better your chances for the talent to accept the invitation. </p></li></ul><p>That’s it! With a few simple steps you can quickly source qualified tech professionals from around the world.

It can be a lengthy process, though if sourcing was done effectively your time spent flicking through resumes (or profiles) will be cut in half. Assuming that you have already disqualified candidates who don’t meet the experience level or lack relevant skills, your time screening will be primarily focused on assessing the personality and cultural fit of candidates. And like we mentioned earlier, <strong>be serious about who you email or reach out to; careless screening methods can damage your brand</strong>, and cause a bad impression for future candidates and employees. </p><h2 id='8-steps-to-effectively-screen-candidates'>8 steps to effectively screen candidates</h2><h3 id='1-consider-what-qualities-you-want-in-a-candidate'>1. Consider what qualities you want in a candidate</h3><p>You probably already have a list of qualities that you would like in a potential employee. You want to see that they align with company values and that they mesh well into the engineering team. You obviously want them to be excited about the product or industry they would be working in, and a startup is going to require a very different personality than a large corporation. But there’s something else to consider: <strong>if you are hiring someone remotely, chances are they will be working remotely or find themselves doing so at some point</strong>. Remote work is not for everyone, and it requires some additional traits you may want to consider in a candidate. </p><h4 id='traits-needed-for-remote-work'>Traits needed for remote work:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Independence</strong>: Being able to work autonomously without direct oversight. Additionally, you want to be able to see that they can - and don’t mind - working alone. The best indicator of this is previous remote work experience. </p></li><li><p><strong>Strong communication</strong>: The role will require continuous written communication through messaging apps and emails, meaning the candidate must be able to articulate complexities through the written word, and navigate the nuances of social interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong>: How self-aware is the candidate? Do they know what conversations are best done via email and which are for video? </p></li><li><p><strong>Experience</strong>: If a candidate has experience working remotely then you can likely assume they understand the challenges of working from home. Candidates without experience may be up to the challenge but they won’t have established structures and boundaries to keep themselves motivated and proactive. </p></li><li><p><strong>Growth mentality</strong>: Ideally you want this trait in every employee, but even more so for someone working remotely. With constant oversight and assistance it’s easy for an employee to grow within a role, but that is a luxury remote workers do not have. Therefore a growth mindset will be essential for them to adapt to feedback and truly grow into the role. </p></li><li><p><strong>Decisiveness</strong>: A remote worker is likely to be in a different time zone, which makes it tricky for quick decision making. The candidate needs to have the confidence and initiative to make sound decisions without relying on others. </p></li><li><p><strong>Hobbies and interests</strong>: If you are considering a candidate for remote work make sure they have interests outside of working hours. It shows that they take care of themselves and value their time off. It’s much easier for someone who is available 24/7 to end up burning out. </p></li></ul><h3 id='2-background-checks-and-skill-tests'>2. Background checks and skill tests</h3><h4 id='google-them'>Google them</h4><p>It’s common practice to check a candidate’s Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn profile. <strong>You will gain a clearer picture of who the candidate is</strong>, their interests, how they express themselves, and what others are saying about them. Twitter is a personal favourite; people really show their true colours there, and you can quickly tell if you’d like working with that person. </p><p>Software engineers often have personal websites and blogs where they create and share personal projects. Their online portfolio will provide some valuable insight into how creative they are, what their passions are, and how knowledgeable they (actually) are. </p><h4 id='coding-challenge'>Coding challenge</h4><p>Some companies make candidates take a test when applying, others prefer to do it after a screening call - whatever the case, it’s a great way to find out if the talent is up for the job, easily measured by a pass or fail. <strong>Asking a candidate to solve a real world problem will tell you more than a resume ever could</strong>. </p><p>We recommend you make your coding challenges and skill tests as real to your business as possible. This could be a problem the team is currently facing, a ticket or a future issue. <strong>Given they are helping solve a real business problem and outside the hours of their regular job, we recommend that you pay them for their time</strong>. The gesture will show goodwill and go a long way for brand reputation. </p><p>On the Honeypot platform, talents are pre-screened with an initial code challenge plus a follow up screening call with our Talent Management team. This ensures that the quality of candidates always remains at a high standard, meaning less time spent screening candidates and quicker technical hires. </p><h3 id='3-the-screening-call'>3. The screening call</h3><p>This is more or less the last stage of the screening process before you move on to skill tests and the interview stage. For a remote setting, the best way to conduct the call is via video conferencing. Yes, phone calls can be easily scheduled and are a little less intimidating, but we prefer video chat as it allows for a better and more personal interaction, which is important for building rapport in a remote setting. It also helps build trust and introduces the candidate to your company in a more personable way. </p><p>A qualified software engineer will most likely be pursuing multiple job offers at once, so <strong>the relationship you establish is key in motivating them to consider you company</strong>, and encourage them to take the skill test (a factor that causes high drop-off rates). Your conversation will likely be tailored to the candidate’s level of skill and how desperate you are to fill the position. Beyond that, there are a few things you will want to give and take from the call.</p><h4 id='here-are-the-things-you-want-to-do-in-a-screening-call'>Here are the things you want to do in a screening call:</h4><ul><li>Get to know them and gather a feeling for their personality  </li><li>Find out about their interests </li><li>Share insights about the company (why they would want to work there)</li><li>Build trust and motivation towards the role and company</li><li>Explain what the hiring process entails, and set expectations for success and failure ahead of time</li></ul><p>A quick note on <em>call scheduling</em>: Don’t just call candidates at any random time. With plenty of warning, coordinate a time which works best for them, taking into account location and working hours (there are some handy timezone tools below). A nice extra touch would be to send them the agenda ahead of time so they are also prepared for what to expect in the call (this will be appreciated by those anxious candidates). </p><h3 id='4-ask-the-right-questions-and-give-the-right-info'>4. Ask the right questions and give the right info</h3><p>In the screening call your goal is to determine if they will be a good fit for the role, so ask questions which drive at the heart of the matter and avoid ones which waste time and provide little information, for example, ‘if you were an animal what would you be?’ - it doesn’t make so much sense. Instead, explore their background, and talk with them about what they are and are not looking for in their next role. You may also want to test their knowledge if you yourself are well-versed in technical topics. </p><h4 id='here-are-some-examples-of-remote-questions-you-could-ask'>Here are some examples of remote questions you could ask:</h4><ul><li>Do you have previous remote work experience?</li><li>What tools have you used previously for collaboration and remote work?</li><li>How do you track your projects and time effectively?</li><li>What does your work environment look like?</li><li>How do you stay in touch with the rest of the team?</li><li>What kind of hours do you like to work?</li></ul><h4 id='information-you-should-share-for-remote-workers'>Information you should share for remote workers:</h4><ul><li>How the company will set them up remotely (do they need to organise their own setup or will the company issue it?)</li><li>The remote onboarding process </li><li>How often they will need to visit the office (will travel expenses be paid?) </li><li>Remote working expectations (hours, responsibilities, rules, requirements, etc.)</li></ul><h3 id='5-create-an-evaluation-process'>5. Create an evaluation process</h3><p>The next step is to create an evaluation process which you can use to measure candidates after the screening call so that you are not just going off of your gut feeling. If you had positive or negative feelings towards a candidate it’s best to be able to articulate them as you’ll likely be defending your decision later on or providing rejected candidates with feedback (highly recommended!).</p><h4 id='here-are-some-things-to-consider-when-evaluating-a-candidate'>Here are some things to consider when evaluating a candidate:</h4><ul><li>Response time</li><li>Preparedness - How much they researched the role (how committed)</li><li>Communication style</li><li>Technical knowledge </li><li>Their interest in the role/company</li></ul><h3 id='6-candidate-screening-tools'>6. Candidate screening tools</h3><p>Candidate screening tools will help you through the entire process while managing a variety of needs. </p><p><strong>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</strong></p><p>An ATS is a great tool to manage applications and filter candidates based on certain criteria. The downside is that these tools are often costly - it makes sense if you get high rates of inbound traffic. If you handle the sourcing, use cheaper project management tools like Trello or Monday.com. </p><ul><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.capterra.com/applicant-tracking-software/'>A list of the top ATS</a></li></ul><p><strong>Team communication</strong> </p><p>There will likely be a lot of back and forth between team members.

This may help you consider looking outside of local talent pools to the international market for talent recruitment. </p><h3 id='7-how-to-turn-down-a-candidate-painlessly'>7. How to turn down a candidate painlessly</h3><p>Once the developer is screened you’ll either be progressing them to the next stage or discontinuing with them. For the latter you will need to communicate the news in a gentle but honest way. Always provide constructive feedback and let them know why you won&#39;t be continuing their application. <strong>Feedback like this is appreciated, and if handled correctly, disqualified candidates will likely still view the company in a positive light</strong>.</p><p>Here are some steps you can take to ensure a candidate is turned away painlessly:</p><p><strong>Tell the candidate promptly</strong> </p><p>Don’t wait until the end of the hiring cycle to share the bad news. Update unsuccessful candidates as quickly as possible so you aren’t delaying their job search any longer. It also shows respect for the candidate’s time, which will certainly be appreciated. </p><p><strong>Call them back</strong></p><p>Emails aren’t the best medium for sharing bad news. If you’ve spoken to them via video or over the phone, give them a quick call to relay the news. Make the call as quick and painless as possible, thank them for their time, and if possible follow up with an email recapping the conversation.  </p><p><strong>Get to the point</strong></p><p>Avoid getting into a discussion on why they weren’t the best fit. Be clear and to the point as to why exactly they won&#39;t be moving forward to the next stage. Make sure your feedback is constructive so they can get an idea as to where they might need improvement. Don’t be overly apologetic, and don’t sugarcoat your feedback.   </p><p><strong>Be personable</strong></p><p>It doesn’t matter how many unsuccessful candidates you are calling to share the bad news, make sure you are showing them respect and not just treating them as if they were another number. Use their name, mention something that you spoke about with them, and wish them on their way. </p><p><strong>Tell the truth</strong></p><p>Maybe the unsuccessful candidate was a great cultural fit yet not up to scratch on the technical side of things, and you want to stay in touch with them for a future role. Let them know this, and tell them that you will save their details for a future role (add them on LinkedIn!). </p><p><strong>Finally, ask THEM for feedback</strong></p><p>One great way to improve the experience of your hiring process is to ask for feedback from applicants. <strong>Applicants will honestly point to the strengths and flaws in your process, helping you to improve for future hiring cycles</strong>. Requesting feedback also shows that you respect the opinions of the candidates, and asking for feedback from both successful and unsuccessful candidates will ensure your procedure is fair and transparent. </p><h3 id='8-moving-candidates-on-to-the-next-stage'>8. Moving candidates on to the next stage</h3><p>Finally, you will be moving the successful candidates to the next stage of the hiring process which will be interviewing and eventually resulting in a hire or hires depending on your needs.

By developing a remote onboarding process now, <strong>you’re not only getting ahead, you are likely fixing a flawed process</strong> (just <a target='_blank' href='https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247172/problems-onboarding-program.aspx'>12% of respondents</a> in a Gallup Survey stated that their company does a great job with onboarding). To help you get off on the right foot, we’ve compiled some best practices for you to implement in your own company onboardings.  </p><p align='center'><img alt='we work remotely' src='/assets/images/we-work-remotely.png' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><h2 id='start-a-checklist'>Start a checklist</h2><p>Most recruiters and managers start with a list of things that they will need the new developer to do, but you should start by creating a checklist for yourself. A lot of your initial processes will actually look the same, like setting up their systems, creating their accounts, sending them emails with company information, and so on. <strong>There are, however, a few things you might have to do differently</strong> - add them to your checklist if they work for you: </p><ul><li><p>Start the onboarding process <strong>as soon as the candidate has signed the contract.</strong> This might be weeks out from their actual start date. The sooner your remote onboarding process can begin, the easier it will be once they officially start. </p></li><li><p>If your new hire won’t be using their own equipment, <strong>send them the computer they need for the job</strong>; ideally, it should have the necessary software already installed. Send your newbie instructions for connecting to your company VPN network, too (if need be). Here’s a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-use-a-vpn-connection-for-remote-work-in-windows-10/'>how-to for Windows</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-a-vpn-connection-on-mac-mchlp2963/mac'>one for Mac</a>. </p></li><li><p>Create a checklist to <strong>ensure the employee has created accounts</strong> for all of your company tools and add some deadlines. </p></li><li><p>Encourage your new employee to set up a space for themselves which is dedicated to work. <strong>Send them some helpful resources about working remotely</strong> - like <a target='_blank' href='https://x-team.com/blog/10-secrets-to-becoming-a-great-remote-developer/'>this</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://shift.infinite.red/my-remote-developer-life-ama-bb91fa7bd0bd#.kjpehbcab'>this</a>. </p></li><li><p>If your resources allow it, <strong>have some introductions prepared via video</strong> (then you don’t have to spend half the day in a video call) - ideas range from a Co-Founder introduction to a screen recording of how to set up a particular tool. </p></li><li><p>To help them with social integration, <strong>include them in company wide communication channels (Slack, Teams, etc.) before they start</strong>. This will give them a chance to get a feel for the company culture beforehand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Share a schedule of their first days</strong> working remotely to help them get into the right headspace. </p></li><li><p>Organise a mentor or buddy for the new employee and <strong>get them in touch as soon as possible</strong>. Make sure the mentor&#39;s schedule is relatively clear, especially in the first week. </p></li><li><p>For their first week, <strong>set up 1-on-1 chats with the people in their new team</strong> - these conversations will help the new hire get to know their colleagues or help them understand the work better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make a list of contacts for the newbie</strong> - who should they contact for what? For example, if they have a question about holidays or sick leave, then they should contact this person in that department. </p></li><li><p><strong>Schedule regular pair-programming</strong> with other members of the team. </p></li><li><p><strong>Set up daily check-ins</strong> with a main point of contact - probably their mentor - via video chat, especially in the first week. </p></li><li><p><strong>Invest in some extra tech</strong> - <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job#tools'>here’s a great list</a> of programs trusted by distributed teams.</p></li></ul><br /><h2 id='prepare-for-the-first-day'>Prepare for the first day</h2><p>According to Web Onboarding, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.webonboarding.com/images/resources/Webonboarding_Global_Report-Whitepaper.pdf'>60% of new hires said they experienced problems</a> or issues on the first day of the job. <strong>The first day is already overwhelming for many new employees, and is even more so when it’s experienced remotely</strong>. Your role is especially important.</p><p>Here’s an example of how you could structure your day:</p><h3 id='welcome-onboarding'>Welcome onboarding</h3><ul><li><strong>Share your screen</strong></li></ul><p>Your welcome onboarding will be similar to how it’s done in person. Maybe you have a powerpoint presentation about the company and culture, and you take the new hires through the different company tools - this can be easily done through screen-sharing.</p><ul><li><strong>Be vulnerable</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t be afraid to be honest if the situation is also new for you. You’ve had to adapt to remote circumstances, and by setting expectations early on, they’ll have more understanding when things go awry. </p><ul><li><strong>Set expectations</strong></li></ul><p>Be clear about what they can expect over the next few weeks. Walk them through the timelines. </p><p>Julie, <a target='_blank' href='https://tettra.com/article/remote-employee-onboarding-checklist-building-structure-and-flexibility-for-an-async-team/'>Head of People at Animalz</a>, says “you can use your onboarding checklist to promote independent work and responsibility in new hires”. Give your employee a list of things they need to  complete in the first week, <strong>trust that it will get done and check in on the progress at the end of it</strong>. This gives an opportunity for the employee to work at their own pace, and they can also work on whatever tasks they want to in the moment. They can truly be independent and take responsibility - these two attributes are what you hired them for. </p><h3 id='introduce-them-to-their-buddy'>Introduce them to their buddy</h3><p>You should have already set up a video call ahead of time so the new hire can meet their buddy; they don’t necessarily have to be a fellow developer. It might be wise to avoid assigning them to employees with a lot of responsibilities. </p><p>The person you assign will be the point of contact for them through the entire onboarding process, so they should be readily available to the new hire. <strong>Outlining your communication expectations for both them and the buddy is really important</strong>; <a target='_blank' href='https://www.halfhalftravel.com/remote-work/stay-connected-while-working-from-home.html'>this article</a> gives some great insight into this.  </p><p>Being a remote employee takes adjustment - especially when you weren’t supposed to be one, so getting them connected with the right person is key. <a target='_blank' href='https://youteam.io/blog/onboarding-a-remote-developer-traps-to-avoid-and-tips-for-success/'>Here’s a list</a> of some responsibilities the buddy could take on. </p><h3 id='organise-a-team-lunch'>Organise a team lunch</h3><p>The team lunch can still happen via video.

You can always spice it up with some fun <a target='_blank' href='https://biz30.timedoctor.com/virtual-team-building/'>team building activities</a> to get the conversations rolling. </p><h3 id='team-onboarding'>Team Onboarding</h3><p>Go about it how you usually would, just don’t forget to share your screen. </p><br /><p>For a complete 4-week onboarding schedule, we’d recommend reading about Zapier’s onboarding process for their software engineers which <a target='_blank' href='https://zapier.com/engineering/engineer-onboarding/'>they’ve published here</a>. The article outlines <strong>how one can effectively set up a developer environment, combined with some examples of projects and tasks which set their new hire up for early wins</strong>. Over at Arc <a target='_blank' href='https://arc.dev/blog/remote-developer-onboarding-experience-7z0iu5fu3h'>they give further insights</a> into building a remote developer onboarding. </p><br /><h2 id='communicate-about-communication'>Communicate about communication</h2><p>The biggest changes you will go through are with regards to how you communicate with your employee(s), and <strong>how you can best set them up for success as they navigate this new role remotely</strong>. Ultimately you want to give the right tools to them so they can be collaborative, communicative and productive in the way you need them to be. </p><p>Ensuring early wins for remote employees will be tougher than for onsite employees, which means your process should be crystal clear. It all comes down to effective communication. </p><h3 id='the-golden-rule'>The Golden Rule</h3><p>Without proper communication, your new hire might be one of the 60% whom I referenced earlier. There are two types of communication: synchronous and asynchronous. You should practise both during the onboarding process.</p><h3 id='synchronous-communication'>Synchronous Communication</h3><p>Synchronous communication is <strong>communication which takes place in real-time</strong> - so, conversations over the phone, in person, or through instant messaging apps. A person sends a message and expects a prompt response. During the onboarding process, synchronous communication with new hires should be encouraged. There should be a dedicated member of their team who can be on the receiving end of it. </p><p>Since this type of communication can be disruptive, it’s important the person you choose to be their buddy is willing to be contacted anytime, and the same goes for selecting a ‘contact-person’ from the team. Assure them that it won’t be forever, but highlight that <strong>it’s important for the new employee to feel wholly supported during this process</strong> (Remember, they might not have signed up for a remote gig!) Imagine how isolated they might feel. Being able to practise synchronous communication during this phase is setting them up for success, but it should not be for the long-term. </p><h3 id='asynchronous-communication'>Asynchronous Communication</h3><p>On the other hand, asynchronous communication happens without the expectation that team members need to respond immediately. It’s the kind of communication that takes place during projects through external tools like GitHub, Trello, or Notion, or even email. </p><p>It is less of a distraction which <strong>increases productivity, allows for thoughtful communication, and gives greater control over the structure of a workday</strong>. At Honeypot, some of our teams have vowed to ‘check-in’ three times a day: once in the morning to say ‘hey!’,  before and after lunch, then finally when we’re checking out at the end of the working day. By checking in three times a day, we stay up to date with the team while enjoying blocks of uninterrupted focus time. </p><p>Implement whatever is best for you and your company, but don’t forget the golden rule. Make your expectations for communication clear from the beginning. </p><h3 id='communication-tools'>Communication tools</h3><p>To get the most out of your remote communication, it will be necessary to level up your toolkit. Here are some great tools used for asynchronous communication:</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://codeshare.io/'>Codeshare</a></strong></p><p>“An online code editor for interviews, troubleshooting, teaching &amp; more…” This is a great tool for distributed engineering teams and for new engineering hires going through the onboarding process.</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://basecamp.com/'>Basecamp</a></strong></p><p>A remote company who built a tool to run their remote company. Basecamp centralises all team communication.</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://funretro.io/'>FunRetro</a></strong></p><p>Another one made for remote teams - specifically remote engineering teams. This tool is for retrospectives.</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='http://trello.com'>Trello</a></strong></p><p>Similar to FunRetro. Manage your projects, conduct your retros, and see clearly who is responsible for what. It’s transparent and easy. </p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://miro.com/'>Miro</a></strong></p><p>A collaborative whiteboarding platform. It supports agile workflows and allows for real-time collaborative work to take place.</p><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://monday.com/'>Monday</a></strong></p><p>A workplace management tool where  teams can collaborate, organise and track work progress. </p><p>Consider your needs before making your decision (i.e. team size, budget and bandwidth). Most of these tools offer 30-day trial periods, so you can test which of them makes sense for your team. Refer to <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job#communication'>this GitHub page</a> for a more comprehensive list.</p><br /><h2 id='building-community-and-staying-connected'>Building Community and Staying Connected</h2><p>As humans, we have a need to belong, <strong>but how do you create a sense of belonging when you can’t be together</strong>? This is the biggest question asked by companies who are built on remote work. Ensuring that your new hire connects with their colleagues and achieves social integration is a remote challenge, but it can be overcome.</p><p>There are many tools which can be used to ensure social connection occurs remotely, but according to David and Shane <a target='_blank' href='https://www.15five.com/blog/wfh-essentials-remote-workforce/'>in this 15five podcast</a>, you should have the right mindset, the right practices and ultimately the right intention. They say, “you have to create a structure to create a sense of belonging… and it comes down to rituals, behaviours and practices” (listen to the whole podcast for more ideas!). </p><p>For your new hire, it’s important they feel included and emotionally connected with their colleagues. This only goes so far with written communication. Below is a list of ideas to help ensure your new employee can connect with their colleagues: </p><ul><li><strong>Set up virtual coffee</strong> with other people in the company (not just in the team). You know best who would be great for this. </li><li>If you use Slack, <strong>utilise the ‘Donut’ feature</strong> whereby colleagues are randomly selected to have lunch together. </li><li><strong>Create a ‘virtual kitchen’</strong> where people can jump into a video call and hang out during their lunch hour. Set it up twice a week and encourage your newbie to participate.</li><li><strong>Organise game nights</strong> - this could be Trivia, or get people to download game apps (ie. HouseParty or Heads Up).</li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://icebreaker.range.co/'>Icebreaker</a> allows you to ask some questions to get to know each other a bit better - you could implement these in the beginning of the new hire’s meetings <strong>to help build emotional connection</strong></li><li><strong>Introduce new hires at AllHands or company meetings</strong>. At Honeypot, we ask every new team member to prepare a slide about themselves and what they love doing. This becomes even more important when working remotely! </li><li><strong>Ask the rest of the team to say ‘hi’ via DM</strong> to the newbie within the first month of joining the company. That’s what would happen walking around the office, so don’t forget to mirror it in digital format! </li></ul><p>...and find more ideas <a target='_blank' href='https://www.zenefits.com/workest/how-to-stay-connected-with-your-colleagues-while-working-from-home/'>here</a>.</p><br /><h2 id='takeaways'>Takeaways</h2><p>There isn’t a ‘one-size-fits-all’ to onboardings - every company has their individual needs, tools and processes, and <strong>you already know what will work best for you</strong>. Many of your practices will still apply - they’ll just take place over a computer screen.</p><p>For your remote onboarding to be truly successful, ensure that you set clear expectations, emphasise the importance of communication, and provide plenty of opportunities for newbies to build emotional connections with their new colleagues. See this as the unique and exciting opportunity that it is and enjoy the benefits of your newly engaged and integrated remote employees.</p>",

Now that you’ve finally settled into a new routine, you may be finding yourself with a few more hours at hand (a big shock compared to the usual hectic pace of recruitment!). And you think to yourself, now what? When the chaos is over and it&#39;s time to start recruiting again, <strong>how do you make sure you are at the top of your game</strong>? Here are seven things to do in <a target='_blank' href='https://candor.co/hiring-freezes/'>a hiring freeze</a> to make sure you come out on top. </p><h2 id='conduct-unconscious-bias-and-interview-trainings'>Conduct unconscious bias and interview trainings</h2><p>Now that your engineering managers and the hiring panels have more free time in their calendars, there’s no excuse not to have interview and unconscious bias training. You could opt to create a curriculum that is specific to your company and existing hiring teams, hire a coach to have your training online as a webinar, or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.themuse.com/advice/9-free-online-classes-for-managers-diversity-inclusion'>sign up for an online course series.</a></p><p>This would also be the perfect time to <strong>invite new people to train for and join your interview panels</strong>. Whether this is for technical or cultural fit interviews, new perspectives always add to the hiring process and get you one step closer to hiring the right talent. This way when hiring kicks off again, you won&#39;t be scrambling to put together hiring panels since you will have more people to choose from. </p><h3 id='clean-up-or-change-your-ats'>Clean up or change your ATS</h3><p>If you and your team have spent what feels like forever wishing your applicant tracking system would do more for you, had a better interface, or was simply cheaper, this is the right time to start scouting for a new one. With your recruiting process mostly moving to online interactions <strong>your applicant tracking system can start to work as your personal assistant</strong>, making sure that you are responsive to talents on time and that your data collection from your interview panels is seamless and as detailed as possible.</p><p>Now is the time to sit down and talk to different client representatives and ask the right questions to see if their platform is the right one for you. You also have more time to reach out to your network and see what your peers recommend.  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/'>The HR Technologist</a> has compiled a list of the top 10 applicant tracking systems for 2020, but a few of our recommendations include: </p><ul><li><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.jobvite.com/'>Jobvite</a></strong> - Great for busy teams that are looking to emphasise referrals and has a built in scheduler for interviews. </p></li><li><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/29/smartrecruiters-raises-50-million-to-help-companies-hire-the-best-talent/'>Smart Recruiters</a></strong> - Makes use of machine learning and AI to help companies make the best hire. </p></li><li><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.greenhouse.io/'>Greenhouse</a></strong> - Popular for its features that claim to reduce bias by focusing on the core skills needed for the job using scorecards.</p></li><li><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.personio.com/'>Personio</a></strong>- Known for excellent customer service and the ease with which you can create reports on the platform.</p></li><li><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.lever.co/'>Lever</a></strong>- Has an ever expanding list of integrations including Zoom, Linkedin and Google Suite while maintaining a simple interface.</p></li></ul><p>If you are one of the lucky ones with an applicant tracking system that’s already excellent, then take time to make it even better. You could clean up your old interview notes, put each candidate in the right stage of the process and follow up on any missing interview notes from your interviewing panels. This is also the perfect opportunity to create a database for talents who you may want to consider inviting back into your process in the future. </p><h3 id='work-on-your-job-descriptions'>Work on your job descriptions</h3><p>Work closely with your hiring managers to see if the job descriptions you have on public platforms accurately reflect what you are looking for. For example, <strong>are there any skills that you have realised are more “nice to have” than important for the role?</strong></p><p>As the business needs have grown and changed so could the requirements for the roles you have open; maybe you need to update the seniority of your tech roles to show the new expectations. And of course you could always shorten your job descriptions to fit the <a target='_blank' href='https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/tips-writing-job-descriptions/'>recommended 500-600 words</a> and run them through <a target='_blank' href='http://www.hemingwayapp.com/'>a free online editor</a> that can make your writing more concise and clear.</p><h3 id='refine-your-processes'>Refine your processes</h3><p>There is a wealth of resources on what the <a target='_blank' href='https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/tips-writing-job-descriptions/'>companies developers</a> love are doing to make sure they pick the right talents. <strong>By doing a deep dive into their best practices</strong> you could hone in on which steps you could benefit from adding or removing from your existing interview process.</p><p>You can also look at what developers <a target='_blank' href='https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/'>are talking about amongst themselves</a> in online forums. We know that employer branding can be one of the most valuable assets for companies looking to hire the best talents. Having a smooth recruiting process that candidates love is one sure way to leverage this in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/job-seekers-use-glassdoor-reviews/'>the online reviews</a> candidates give after interviews. </p><h3 id='work-on-your-tech-and-industry-expertise'>Work on your tech and industry expertise</h3><p>Tech trends are constantly changing and so does the knowledge it takes to keep up with recruiting for developers. <strong>It&#39;s always a good idea to take online courses</strong> to refresh your tech recruitment skill sets - a few of these also offer certifications so that they are an investment towards your recruitment career and ensure that you can showcase your knowledge. <a target='_blank' href='https://geekruiter.com/academy/'>Geekruiter</a> Academy has a down to earth approach to its tech recruitment courses that also feature courses from CTOs and Senior IT recruiters, which will be useful in stakeholder management with tech hiring teams. <a target='_blank' href='https://devskiller.com/introducing-devskiller-tech-recruitment-certification-course/'>Dev Skiller</a> is a (free) online recruitment course complete with readings on sourcing as well as certification, it covers the entire interview process and offers suggestions on how to build interview processes as well. </p><p>You can also participate in webinars for your specific industry to refine your employer value proposition for your potential talents. </p><h3 id='improve-your-candidate-experience'>Improve your candidate experience</h3><p>There is always something to learn from every talent who goes through your interview process. <strong>This feedback can be used as an opportunity for growth</strong> for members of your hiring panels who are still mastering recruitment, as well as to find out what talents expect versus what they experience in the recruitment process. Quick Google or Mailchimp surveys are a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.talentlyft.com/en/resources/recruitment-satisfaction-survey-questions'>simple yet important way</a> to keep track of this feedback and to make sure that you continue to evolve as a recruitment team. Some <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/candidate-experience-survey'>questions to include</a> could look like the following: </p><ul><li>did the candidate feel they were given tasks that allowed them to showcase their skills?</li><li>how your interview process compares to other companies the talent is interviewing with?</li><li>how informed the candidate felt regarding their interview status throughout the process? </li></ul><p>After the candidate completes all the stages of the interview process this feedback can also be shared with the entire hiring team as part of your debriefings. This gives the opportunity to refine your processes collectively. </p><p>You can automate the surveys so that they are sent out a few days after talents complete the interview process. If you could never find the time to implement these systems, now would be a good time to start and perhaps even reach out to past talents who may still be willing to give feedback. </p><h3 id='enhance-your-employer-brand'>Enhance your employer brand</h3><p>Hiring for developers is <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pagepersonnel.co.uk/our-expertise/finance/candidate-driven-market'>a candidate driven market</a>, so <strong>it&#39;s in a company’s best interest to stand out to candidates</strong> and make their <a target='_blank' href='https://www.personio.com/blog/employer-value-proposition/'>employer value proposition clear</a>. Doing this attracts the right talents and gives them an idea of whether or not they might be a cultural fit for your company. Two effective ways to do this is through your social media and blog.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.themuse.com/advice/social-media-for-employer-branding'>Social Media</a> often falls to the wayside as more urgent tasks take center stage in the daily recruitment grind. It would be worthwhile to take time to craft a social media strategy now, and make use of the platforms where your ideal candidates tend to spend the most time. </p><p>Blog posts that offer insight into your different departments and their daily tasks are useful for candidates who will have technical interviews. Tthese can go in- depth, including the tech architecture and details about the <a target='_blank' href='https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/'>projects that different engineering teams</a> have been working on. They can also chronicle the career growth of developers in the company as a source of inspiration for future employees. </p><p>Interviews and profiles with key people in teams are always welcome as they highlight <a target='_blank' href='https://jobs.zalando.com/en/culture/?gh_src=4n3gxh1'>different facets</a> of working for the company and offer first- hand perspectives into what employees like about working there. <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/women-of-honeypot/'>Honeypot’s blog</a> does just this and centers these stories and interviews around themes that give potential employees insights into life at the company.</p><p>You can read more about the benefits of employer branding <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/benefits-of-employer-branding/'>over here.</a></p><h2 id='takeaways'>Takeaways</h2><p>The next few weeks will be an interesting challenge as we change the way we view work and recruitment.

It’s easy to get lost in the brambles of online messaging, therefore it’s up to the manager or team lead to clearly define how communication will take place within the team and the wider company.</p><p>Since you won’t be able to tap your colleague on the shoulder or gather the troops for a quick team sync, you’ll have to re-think your typical communication strategy. Here are a few ways you can do that.</p><br /><h3 id='keys-to-successful-remote-communication'>Keys to successful remote communication</h3><p>You might have felt a stab of anxiety as your team members relocated to their homes for quarantine. The concerns of limited project control and invisible staff can stir a minor panic. Like many, you weren’t prepared for a crisis - but don’t worry, by implementing the correct protocols and expectations for remote workers you’ll be up to scratch in no time!</p><br /><p><strong>Accountability</strong></p><p>Accountability in a team is best established through written guidelines. This way, each member understands exactly what is expected of them throughout the day, week, month and year. You may have them recording hours, posting regularly, documenting their daily work - however it looks on paper, make sure to express it clearly and pin it as an accessible reference point. </p><br /><p><strong>Transparency</strong></p><p>&nbsp; You’ll want to know the ins and outs of what each team member is working on in order to track progress and plan deadlines. A quick way to secure transparency is to schedule regular catch-ups with the team, where you will be able to hear what everyone is working on and how each team member is progressing. With this, everyone will know what they should be doing and what the others in the team are also doing. There are also plenty of workplace management tools which help support team transparency as well, like Jira and Trello (more on these later!). </p><br /><p><strong>Trust</strong> </p><p>Managers can default to micromanaging when thrust into remote work. They can’t see their team or what is being worked on and so bombard workers with messages and emails calling for updates and reminding them of incomplete tasks. This behaviour will only frustrate your team and show a lack of trust. If you have implemented the tools and processes that encourage accountability and transparency, then you shouldn’t have to worry about what your team is doing every minute of the day. </p><br /><p><strong>Vulnerability</strong></p><p>Everyone has different ways of coping with change. Some of us scream into our pillows (me) while others shrug their shoulders and embrace the unknown. It’s important to keep an eye on your team members and see how the changes are affecting them as individuals. Encourage your team to be vulnerable with what’s affecting them and their concerns. Last I checked it wasn’t a crime to feel demotivated or disconnected. These conversations mean you can have a more targeted approach when addressing the team, and it’ll identify how you can best support and lead them through the oncoming months.   </p><br /><p><strong>Remember, you’re the role model</strong> </p><p>This is no different from an office environment. How you conduct yourself in a remote setting will set the standard for your team. If you are late to meetings, or show a lack of engagement, in a weeks time your team will be doing the same. You need to be the role model (now more than ever) of how you’d like your team to behave. It’s not enough to just organise a weekly lunch session or a daily e-coffee, you have to check-in and be present, or those processes you try to implement will quickly deteriorate before your very eyes.  </p><br /><h3 id='best-practices-for-remote-communication'>Best practices for remote communication</h3><p>Here are a few points on how you can maximise the impact of your team’s communication tools, keep your team engaged, and ensure channels are clear and scrubbed clean of any pesky misunderstandings. </p><br /><p><strong>Simplify communication</strong></p><p>At Honeypot, we have 42 nationalities; this means that although we share internal comms in English, we need to be mindful that the majority of our co-workers are not native speakers and may easily misconstrue verbal and written comms. So if you are writing an email, keep it simple and to the point. For important video meetings, assign someone to take notes and ask them to share with everyone after the meeting. </p><br /><p><strong>Work out loud</strong> </p><p>We’re separated by some healthy distance (as you may have guessed), which means we need to be much more proactive in verbalising how we’re spending our time. I’m thinking of all those tasks and responsibilities which aren’t recorded or assigned on a Trello board somewhere, which could be anything from quick-fixes to last-minute requests - whatever it is, encourage your people to verbalise it. It’s as simple as dropping a line in the team Slack channel: ‘Hi team, I’m blasting through a heap of emails this morning, will be back working on X in the arvo!’ It will be a bit odd to begin, but the team will quickly sense the logic behind it. </p><br /><p><strong>Create communication guidelines</strong> </p><p>Since there’s more opportunity for distraction and miscommunication in our comms channels as of late, it’s a good idea to lay down a couple of ‘laws’ to help promote the effectiveness of how people communicate. These may be things like: don’t blow up someone’s chat with ten different messages when the point could have been communicated in one; or always assume good intent in tone, meaning if you get a blunt message or are ignored, don’t take it as a slight - assume they are busy and will get back to you. These types of guidelines help to remove unexpected situations, meaning more effective channels. </p><br /><p><strong>Consider their home life</strong> </p><p>You’ll have coworkers who don’t have a dedicated workspace in their home, they’ll be in their kitchen or lounge room, and others might have kids and parental duties to attend to during the day. These are factors which, before remote work, wasn’t your problem, but now is impacting how a team functions - especially with those little tykes running around and demanding attention. You’re going to have to accept that <a target='_blank' href='https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-your-coworkers-need-right-now-is-compassion'>these ‘home’ problems are now yours also</a>, and you’ll need to make some adjustments to how you work with those individuals facing these new work challenges. </p><br /><p><strong>Create Q and A sessions</strong> </p><p>There are thousands of decisions to be made each day, and many of them are actually made during informal chit-chats we have over coffee and between our desks. These chats are usually not so important to require a meeting, but can quickly fester into bigger problems if left unattended. A nice way to bridge this gap is to <a target='_blank' href='https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-managers-can-support-remote-employees'>hold quick Q and A sessions</a> (maybe an hour a day), where team members can jump on a call with you and have their concerns addressed in a few minutes.</p><br /><p><strong>Over-communicate</strong> </p><p>When dealing with multinational teams in a remote setting, it’s best to repeat important points a number of times to ensure all people understand. A few extra seconds spent on a topic will save you the headache of course-correcting in the future. </p><br /><p><strong>Use pictures and video</strong> </p><p>When troubleshooting, we’d all rather see a screenshot or video tutorial than wade through a complex email. Not only is it easier to follow but it also saves a ton of time! So before you shoot off that next three-page email, ask yourself if there is a more efficient way. You can try screen recording with <a target='_blank' href='https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder'>Screencast</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bandicam.com/free-screen-recorder/'>Bandicam</a> (or if you’re on Mac there’s Quicktime which is free), and for customisable screenshots, you can use <a target='_blank' href='https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html'>Lightshot</a> or an extension available from your browser.   </p><br /><p><strong>Share all decisions</strong> </p><p>You are going to be making a ton of decisions through this transition and out the other side. Management decisions for the team or company-wide should be shared to ensure transparency and company inclusion. Emails are good for this, though you don’t want to be bombarding people with every minor update; best to create a corporate wiki where people can read and opt for notifications (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.notion.so/'>Notion</a> is great for this!). </p><br /><p><strong>Show commitment</strong></p><p>A crisis means course-correcting; your commitments will change and so will your expectations. Something that wasn’t pressing a few weeks ago is now the most important thing for the company. People can quickly adapt to this, but if you’re course-correcting every week you run the risk of leaving your team behind. Each new direction means another break in structure and routine, breeding disheartened and demotivated coworkers. In times of turmoil, it’s incredibly important to re-establish a sense of structure, security and routine, and you can’t do that if you’re changing your mind week-to-week. Create a plan and stick to it as best you can. </p><br /><p><strong>Promote a video-first culture</strong></p><p>To add a human element to the impersonal nature of remote work, prioritise video conferencing in the daily scrum meetings (or any meetings). This will help encourage active participation in the conversations being had and help to maintain your team’s culture over time. A video-first practice means that you’ll be able to observe non-verbal communication and keep tabs on emotional status and mood, which better informs team functionality and management practices.</p><br /><p><strong>Find new ways to motivate</strong> </p><p>Thanks to COVID-19, after work frothies are a no-go, same with rowdy office banter and our usual ways of unwinding. These times of social isolation will see a hit to your team’s motivation and the worst part is: those struggling seldom speak up. The best way to get ahead of a demoralised team is to regularly check in with individual team members (for 1-on-1’s) and always celebrate wins, however small. We like to have a bit of fun when motivating each other and use this <a target='_blank' href='https://inspirobot.me/'>InspiroBot</a> which uses AI to create inspirational quotes. </p><br /><p><strong>Hold weekly hangouts</strong> </p><p>Since you’re out of the office those familiar characters kicking around the lunchroom can quickly become strangers. A weekly get-together will be a good chance to catch up and say ‘hi!’ to colleagues you don’t see regularly which keeps those inter-departmental connections strong! Workshops, trivia games, lightning talks, and demos are all great ways to use this time. But make sure organisers set an agenda and have moderators to avoid the descending chaos (or the mass exodus) of a group video chat.</p><br /><p><strong>Use a buddy system</strong></p><p>If you’ve already got the system in place, bring it online! E-coffees, lunches or catch-ups are a great way to help people to socialise outside of their immediate team. For those using Slack, you may be familiar with the plugin called ‘Donut’ which pairs random employees for weekly coffees where they can discuss work, life or share a joke. Keeping people connected goes a long way in boosting morale and inclusion, and this is a simple way to do it.</p><br /><h3 id='managing-conflict-remotely'>Managing conflict remotely</h3><p>Is someone throwing shade from afar? Sooner or later conflict will arise in the team and you’ll be forced to handle it - online. Your best defence is preparation, but as we all know that’s not always possible. Some things are just out of your control, for example, laggy internet, disgruntled employees, and hard-to-work-with clients. Here are a few things you can do to stop conflict gaining ground in your team. </p><br /><p><strong>Give emotional support</strong></p><br /><p>Abrupt change is likely to ruffle some feathers, so it’s important that you are present and actively listening to employee’s concerns about stress and anxiety (remember the 1-on-1’s mentioned earlier). Listen to their struggles and help where you can, and don’t just ask, ‘how are you doing?’ - it’s a question which naturally encourages people to reduce their feelings to one word, and doesn’t tend to elicit openness. Instead, you can ask tailored questions to their situation, for example: </p><ul><li>How are you finding your transition to remote work so far? </li><li>What do you like, and not like, about remote work?</li><li>How can I support you in this transition? </li></ul><p>Once you’ve asked the questions, make sure to listen to their response. Always put the employee’s stress and concern front-and-centre of the conversation. </p><br /><p><strong>Define ‘complete’</strong> </p><p>A common issue for remote teams is that there is rarely a conversation around what completed work exactly entails. You can eliminate vague work by having a list of project objectives which qualify each task. This way all members can clearly communicate when something is finished or is still in progress.</p><br /><p><strong>Create dedicated channels</strong> </p><p>There are a million different ways to share information online, which is fantastic for us impulsive types, but not so fantastic for documentation and project organisation. To curb the threat of crossed-wires and doubling up, create dedicated channels for each topic. This will mean everything is documented in one place, so you won’t have to comb through hundreds of email threads to find the info you are looking for, and you’ll pat yourself on the back when it comes to onboarding a newbie.</p><br /><p><strong>Hire good writers</strong></p><p>If you’re doing it right, 90% of your remote team’s communication will be text-based, meaning you want your teammates to be strong communicators of the written word to help avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary grievances. So as you do make remote hires, make sure you assess them for their ability to write. </p><br /><p><strong>Provide regular feedback</strong> </p><p>Since it’s a transition period for many, you should be proactive in providing constant feedback to your team members. This will help them adjust to their new working environment and make them better remote workers. The way you share feedback is up to you; it might be through an HR tool, via call or direct message. Just make sure the serious feedback is done face-to-face (video call).  </p><br /><p><strong>Consider cultural and language differences</strong> </p><p>Avoid a clash of culture by erasing vague and socially-nuanced messages which can easily be misinterpreted. You know what I mean - even a simple phrase like, ‘it’s fine’ can be read several different ways. Use punctuation and emojis to better translate your feelings through messaging apps to avoid unintended confrontations. </p><br /><p><strong>Deal with hostile people</strong></p><p>It might be the case that you have to deal with a hostile team member or client - forget messaging! A video call is far better for these types of situations, they will become more self-aware and patient since they will be forced to see themselves. It’ll also be a time-saver; a two-minute call will clear up something that might take 30 minutes to communicate over a direct message. </p><br /><p><strong>Minimise surrounding distractions</strong> </p><p>Gently enforce some rules around where team members work and take calls. Nagging kids, pets, and loud work environments can upset the entire flow of a conversation or meeting. You don’t have to assume these incidents are common-place either. Exercise some patience but be quick to enforce those rules. It will be appreciated team-wide and reduce the emotional strain on your team. </p><br /><h2 id='12-collaboration'>1.2 Collaboration</h2><p>Aligning a team working from different corners of the world is going to be a challenge, but one that is easily overcome by organised project management and a few nifty tools.  </p><br /><h3 id='development-practices'>Development practices</h3><p>Remote project management will require you to up the level of planning which goes into each initiative. If you are a shoot-from-the-hip type manager, don’t be! Here are some steps that you can take to best leverage your next remote team project:</p><br /><p><strong>Scrum agile practices</strong> </p><p>Already using these practices? Perfect! Take them online and continue as usual. Scrum and agile methodologies will help boost flexibility and productivity in the team while fostering an environment built on honesty, accountability and trust. Many developer teams use tools like Jira and Trello to dashboard these practices online. </p><br /><p><strong>Responsibility</strong> </p><p>Make sure it’s clear to everyone who is working on what, and who is responsible for the assigned tasks. Avoid those open-ended conversations which usually end with someone saying, ‘yeah, we could do something like that.’ Everyone should be 100% sure of what they are working on and what you expect of them. The best way to do this is by assigning tasks, putting them down on ‘paper’ and communicating what you ‘need’ instead of what you’d ‘like’ someone to do. </p><br /><p><strong>Automation</strong> </p><p>Automate everything that you can - this is something that should always be at the front of your mind. Automation of processes will increase high-impact output from small and large remote teams. There are a bunch of testing and scheduling tools out there; <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/@briananderson2209/best-automation-testing-tools-for-2018-top-10-reviews-8a4a19f664d2'>take your pick!</a></p><br /><p><strong>Getting started guide</strong> </p><p>The first thing to do in the era of remote work is to put together a ‘getting started’ guide. As the team learns and gets into the groove of remote work, they will adopt methods for best-practice work. It’s highly advised to document this process and keep updating the doc as you all grow. This way if anyone new steps in, you can hand them the guide and send them on their merry way. And it’ll be a good reference point to come back to if anyone ever needs clarification. </p><br /><p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong> </p><p>A global team means different time zones which will inevitably cause communication barriers and scheduling conflicts. Different working times can block the progress of a project as people might be waiting around until others jump online. Get ahead of this problem by investing time into guidelines and documentation. That way if a question arises, the information is there. If it’s an issue with bugs, implement a system of filing bug reports so developers can move on and get to work. </p><br /><p><strong>Designate a leader</strong> </p><p>For teams working across different time zones, it’s best to designate leaders who can be responsible for making decisions and moving the team forward. </p><br /><p><strong>Feasibility checks</strong> </p><p>Scoping for tickets will be more tricky since you can’t just grab someone for a minute or two for a quick rundown. Jumping between stakeholder, project manager, and the developer is going to waste a ton of time. We find the best approach is to just invite the stakeholder to the relevant scrum meetings so all questions can be answered on the spot and no Chinese whispers occur. And they can easily leave the call once the issue is resolved, saving a lot of headaches from all sides. </p><br /><p><strong>Crisis leadership</strong></p><p>This crisis has really magnified some weaknesses in our processes and management - for most of us, it’s a lack of preparedness. So <a target='_blank' href='https://hbr.org/2020/04/4-behaviors-that-help-leaders-manage-a-crisis'>let’s use this time</a> (once you’re in the swing of things) to make sure we aren’t caught flat-footed. You can do this by investing and coaching the leaders who are below you to position them for success given another shakeup like this occurs. It’s a good opportunity to create a resilient and prepared developer team who can adapt with confidence. </p><br /><p><strong>Get nit-picky</strong></p><p>With all the distractions of remote work, standards can drop. Be quick to address these standards promptly. It will enforce work ethic and remind team members to remain detail-orientated wherever they might be working. </p><br /><h3 id='collaboration-tools'>Collaboration tools</h3><p>The role of remote project management can be made far easier with the help of collaboration tools. Tools will allow you to monitor team progress, share feedback, track time, communicate efficiently, increase team productivity and so on.

The good news is that developers are generally much happier and productive in remote situations anyway, so the tweaks you make will be less to do with social aspects (phew!) and more towards execution of actual tasks. Here are a few ways to ensure a higher level of productivity in your online workplace: </p><br /><h3 id='best-practices'>Best practices</h3><p><strong>Mail chains</strong> </p><p>Email communication is a terrible medium for back and forth conversation and quickly becomes a major time-waster as you go searching through confusing threads. If you can’t write a tactful email, pick up the phone and give your colleague(s) a call. Save everyone the frustration of following up and double-checking. </p><br /><p><strong>Tools and tech</strong> </p><p>Investing in some of the communication tools mentioned above will certainly improve workflow and increase team productivity. We will potentially work remotely for several weeks so make sure you invest in the hardware and software for your team. An extra monitor can easily double or triple an employee’s productivity. </p><br /><p><strong>VPN</strong></p><p>Since everyone has been working from home we’ve seen some strain for various internet providers - mostly because every man and his dog is watching Netflix! It may affect your internet connection which will mess with video calls, prolong download times, and generally slow the progress of all online work. A smart solution around this bottleneck is to sign up for a Virtual Private Network (VPN) which will encrypt your internet traffic and do wonders for your connection speed.</p><br /><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Encourage your team to get regular exercise. This could be one of the most important factors to influence your team productivity. If it’s a nice, sunny day, let those couch potatoes know they should take a walk or go for a jog before dark - walking from the desk to the kitchen isn’t going to cut it, sorry! Regular exercise is linked to increased happiness, mental health and creativity, and helps to decrease overall stress and anxiety.  </p><br /><p><strong>Watch the DMs</strong></p><p>Instant messaging is a fantastic way to communicate but absolutely stifling to high impact work. Get your team off Slack and other messaging platforms as much as possible. If something is urgent, call. Best to have set periods of time when everyone is reachable to avoid the onslaught of notifications breaking important focus.</p><br /><p><strong>Reward your developers</strong></p><p>REWARD THEM!!! Seriously, celebrating the achievements of team members and rewarding them for good work is always going to increase productivity. In transition periods it will add confidence and value to your team, and it’s important to keep the morale up. For more on showing appreciation remotely, Read part 5.</p><br /><h3 id='common-blockers-and-how-to-combat-them'>Common blockers and how to combat them</h3><p>Workplace productivity can be blocked by a number of external factors. But just because they are out of our control doesn’t mean we can’t find ways around them, or even use them to our advantage. Here are some of the usual suspects and a few suggestions for how you might combat them.</p><br /><p><strong>Time zone differences</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, you won’t always be able to reach team members working in other parts of the world. Don’t let it be a drag on performance though, use it to your advantage! You&#39;ll have people working around the clock on the same project and teams ahead of your time zone can review progress and assign future tasks. </p><br /><p><strong>Burnout</strong></p><p>The chances of burnout can actually increase as teams go remote. The lines between work and rest begin to blur, and you’ll see people quite easily push ten or twelve hours of work. While it sounds great for business, it’s a sure-fire way to ruin mental health and happiness within a team. Watch for these behaviours and ensure everyone is working manageable hours. </p><br /><p><strong>Time management</strong></p><p>With no one over your shoulder you can quickly lose your morning replying to a couple of emails. There are a couple of great tools out there which allow you to track time spent to better manage productivity throughout the day. </p><br /><p><strong>Focus</strong></p><p>All those badges, meetings and notifications will draw your attention away from any meaningful work. The best practice is to narrow focus to high impact work. How can you do that? Replace (some) meetings with emails, create daily rituals, work in a dedicated workspace and block out dedicated ‘do not disturb time’. Here are <a target='_blank' href='https://zapier.com/blog/stay-focused-avoid-distractions/'>some tools</a> you might suggest to your team which’ll encourage focus periods and block out distractions. </p><br /><p><strong>Back-to-back scheduling</strong></p><p>Give yourself some room to breathe! Back-to-back scheduling is a killer for team productivity. </p><br /><p><strong>Poor estimation</strong></p><p>Miscalculating deadlines will bring your productivity to a screeching halt. For the most part, we assume that we can complete tasks quicker than we actually can. When we miss that deadline, not only do we fall behind but it also demotivates us. Set your team reasonable deadlines so team members can work towards over-delivering instead of under.  </p><br /><p><strong>Lack of access to information</strong></p><p>‘Free and open access to information’ - that should be your team’s motto from now on. Ideally, you want to reduce the time and effort it takes to find information from co-workers. Even the simplest of questions that go unanswered can be major blockers to productivity and progress. </p><br /><p><strong>Social isolation</strong></p><p>Yep, we all can feel the hit of social isolation. Probably more so for those extraverts in the team who love a good chat. The longer the isolation drags out the less “belonging” we feel within the company (especially if there aren’t many opportunities to connect with others). </p><br /><p><strong>Distractions at home</strong></p><p>Kids, pets, family, construction workers - you name it, they’ll be in the background causing a stir. As a manager, you need to make some allowance for the team members with family or dependents, but try to encourage them to have dedicated workspaces where they can hide away from distractions and get to work. </p><br /><h2 id='managing-developer-teams-remotely'>Managing developer teams remotely</h2><p>As research indicates, employees look to their managers for support and guidance during sudden changes and crisis situations. Your reactions and management style will trickle-down to those you manage. If you display stress and worry, they will react in kind. </p><p>The best way to approach difficult circumstances such as the COVID crisis is to boost team confidence, offer support (whether you feel it or not), and take up the challenge head-on with a sense of purpose. </p>",

It’s not quite the same, is it? We can’t really identify what makes our company different from the next, and that’s just one station away from ‘why do I even work here in the first place?’ <strong>When the humanised element of work is stripped away, engagement suffers, culture and morale take a hit, and that’s when a team and the company begins to suffer from lower productivity and employee satisfaction</strong>. </p><br /><p>According to a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.gallup.com/workplace/352949/employee-engagement-holds-steady-first-half-2021.aspx'>Gallup study</a>, only 20% of employees are engaged in the workplace, and remote workers <a target='_blank' href='https://hbr.org/2018/11/survey-remote-workers-are-more-disengaged-and-more-likely-to-quit'>reported even lower levels</a> of engagement than their office counterparts.

Once you get the ball rolling with a little creativity, I think it’s something people find a lot of comfort in. And this is something a lot of companies miss because it takes a lot of effort but it’s so important.” ー Hayden Trombo, HR at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.clevertech.biz/'>CleverTech</a></p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://miro.com/guides/remote-work/collaboration-productivity-engagement'>Psychological distance</a> might be one of the biggest destroyers of teams and culture. <strong>The strength, productivity and success of a team hinges on the connections its members have with one another</strong>. When you take a team remote, it’s like driving a wedge through those pre-existing team connections (it’ll feel that way to them at least!). In the absence of office chit-chat, team building activities and collaboration opportunities, people will begin to <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.smarp.com/employee-engagement-8-statistics-you-need-to-know'>disengage and disconnect</a>. To engage employees in effective and lasting ways we need to be focused on answering this core question: how can we continue to build relationships in our new online workplace? </p><br /><h2 id='1-communication-tips-to-engage-remote-teams'>1. Communication tips to engage remote teams</h2><p>We’ve already outlined a few ways to set up communication practices in your remote team in the previous guide (<a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/managing-teams-remotely/'>check out part 4</a>), so here we will share some general tips to improve upon those already existing channels. </p><h3 id='watch-out-for-extroverts-and-introverts'>Watch out for extroverts and introverts</h3><p>Extroverts are great, but they sure do love to hear themselves speak (guilty!), and without proper checks and balances they’ll dominate team conversations, which may make it harder for the less outspoken members (introverts) to share and converse. Keeping quiet isn’t healthy, so remove barriers such as social formalities which cause hesitation and encourage people to be themselves, as they would in the office or at the water cooler. <strong>The more comfortable we feel using the communication channels at our disposal, the more likely we are to share and engage.</strong> </p><h3 id='virtual-hangouts'>Virtual hangouts</h3><p>You’re probably already doing this in some form or another so I won’t harp on for too long. The important thing is to have a space (ideally video-based) which is completely informal to mirror the wacky hallway banter we all love to dip our toes in. Some teams have set Slack channels, others use <a target='_blank' href='https://houseparty.com/'>Houseparty</a> - just keep it non-work related! The reason being that the work-related chat is impersonal; it serves the purpose of getting shit done but not in building strong personal relationships (which is what you want!). It might be worth establishing a few sensible ground rules (language, humour, where the line is) so as to maximise inclusivity. </p><h3 id='take-time-to-learn-about-everyone'>Take time to learn about everyone</h3><p>It’s easy to learn about each other when you’re sitting two feet away. We naturally absorb the personalities around us and it creates a familiarity that bonds us closer together. I might not have much to do with the designer who sits next to me but I sure do get along with him. <strong>That natural bonding has vanished and we need to be proactive in maintaining those lines of communication so that our desk pals don’t fade into the mist.</strong> Put more attention towards those mysterious folk you don’t have much to do with. The risk of interpersonal separation is far greater when remote, and the last thing you want is anything snowballing into something more challenging. </p><p>We asked Kevin Borders, CEO at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.collage.com/'>Collage</a> about his thoughts on remote team communication: “I think being remote, by default, people aren’t as likely to talk to each other, <strong>so be really deliberate around creating opportunities for conversations</strong> — this can be particularly challenging for junior engineers who don’t have as strong of communication and collaboration skills to begin with.” </p><br /><h2 id='2-how-to-manage-remote-team-participation'>2. How to manage remote team participation</h2><p>This is the fun part where you can start getting creative with your team, and let me tell you, virtual lunches are just the tip of the iceberg. We’ve got a few creative ideas to share with you which hopefully ramp up team participation and keep your team buzzing through Corona times. But it’s not all fun and games, you’ll certainly have to deal with those who might not be coping so well, so we’ll also share how you can approach and combat isolation. Let’s jump in!</p><h3 id='encourage-remote-team-participation'>Encourage remote team participation</h3><p>The effort you’ll need to put into encouraging team participation will be strongly determined by what your company culture is. If you have a tight-knit group, you probably won’t have to do much - they might even use their initiative to take care of the problem for you! <strong>But for those struggling, a gentle push will be needed - not to mention some strong leadership</strong>. Here are some of the ways we, at Honeypot, inject a bit of adrenaline into our remote working lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Team rituals</strong> </li></ul><p>Routine and structure are the best remedies to chaos. And as we’ve all been through a bit of a shake-up, the best thing we can do for our teams is to rebuild work structures and rituals. Yes, you’ll have the dailies, and all those other meetings, but let’s think of the rituals we haven’t yet been able to upload. Some of our teams enjoy Friday afternoon drinks together before knocking off for the weekend, while other teams enjoy informal coffee sessions first thing in the morning. You’ll know what works for your team (here are some <a target='_blank' href='https://www.yonder.io/post/how-to-design-powerful-rituals-for-successful-distributed-companies'>ideas</a>), but the important thing is to make it regular so team members can quickly familiarise themselves with the set occasion. And above all else, make sure you champion the idea (if it’s yours); show up and attend, or else it’ll quickly fall apart and work against any future participation.</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual co-working sessions</strong></li></ul><p>Solo work is productive, yes - but it lacks the social element which is so enjoyable about being in an office. Bouncing ideas around the room and pairing up with a colleague to solve ‘that’ problem is one of the joys of the workplace. We don’t want to lose this because we’re remote; it’s a big part of what keeps teams tight-knit. So tee up some time to solve development problems over a video call, together. Some remote teams even join up for video calls as they work separately just to keep table-top banter alive.   </p><ul><li><strong>Community leadership</strong></li></ul><p>The responsibility to handle tricky situations like the one we’re in mostly falls on leadership teams. But there are great ideas all around, and as we all know: the best ideas are born when there’s a crisis or problem. Some of our partners have held virtual Hack weeks, where employees could work to discover solutions to the short-term barriers they were facing. This is a great way to promote community leadership and involve everyone in company-decisions to move forward collectively. </p><ul><li><strong>Community outreach</strong></li></ul><p>As you know many workers in Germany and around the world have been put out of work due to the quarantine but just because we are forced to stay home doesn’t mean we can’t still help those who are less fortunate. Some great initiatives have been set up in the wake of COVID-19 that help local businesses and workers. We know that our colleagues over at XING are donating unused lunch vouchers to the Abendblatt “From Person to Person” campaign, which is distributing food to short term workers and other vulnerable community members in Hamburg. This is a great way to get involved in your local communities and build your team comradery. Here’s <a target='_blank' href='https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article228795687/Hamburg-Corona-Virus-Abendblatt-Hilfsaktion-Not-Spenden-Caritas-Diakonie-Deutsche-Rote-Kreuz-Kirche-Mensch.html'>another great initiative</a> in Hamburg <a target='_blank' href='https://kochen-fuer-helden.de/'>and another</a> which is Germany-wide. A bunch of our team members here at Honeypot have been supporting Helfen Shop Berlin, an initiative which allows you to buy vouchers for your favourite shops to use once the store reopens after quarantine. Maybe you can find an initiative in your local area to rally the troops behind.</p><ul><li><strong>Take your office ONLINE, literally!</strong></li></ul><p>Keep the company culture strong by shipping your remote employees reminders of the office like the objects and aesthetics that represent and identify your brand and community; things like posters, paperweights, stickers - all the fantastic stuff people use to jazz up their home offices. It’s like football jerseys: you may only see your team play twice a year, but that physical reminder keeps you rooting for them all year round (awww I want a shirt too)!</p><br /><h3 id='honeypots-icebreakers-and-team-activities'>Honeypot’s icebreakers and team activities</h3><p>The old team lunch can quickly grow stale - the best way to reignite your team’s spark is to get them active - conversations are great but they only reach so far. Here’s a list of some creative team activities (inspired by Honeypot) which can engage the troops, boost spirits and get the conversations rolling again:</p><ul><li><strong>Cooking challenges</strong></li></ul><p>With a bit more time to spend in the kitchen, some of the Honeypot folk have rolled up their sleeves and opened those dusty old cookbooks to experiment with new recipes. It’s organised as a weekly ‘challenge’ based around a weekly theme, and at the end of each week, the group gathers to share the pictures of their creations. Last week was Vegan week and this week is International week. Here’s a nice mouth-watering collage :)</p><p align='center'><img alt='Honeypot's Cooking Challenge' src='/assets/images/cooking-challenge.png' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><ul><li><strong>Meme groups</strong></li></ul><p>If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry. Bit dramatic but mostly true - humour has a way of turning us all into optimists, and that’s what we need to be in these times! Humour is, in my humble opinion, the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to building, repairing and maintaining relationships. We are probably guilty of going a little overboard with our meme groups; there’s a dozen or so going at any given time, but we know those knee-slappers bring us closer together and the fires burning bright. There are a bunch of ways you can get this started: Slack channels, WhatsApp groups, Messenger - you name it!</p><ul><li><strong>Sharing pics and videos of new hobbies</strong></li></ul><p>A couple of our company go-getters have been using their off-hours to learn new hobbies and skills. Rock climbing, abseiling, mountain biking - yeah, none of the above. Instead, they’ve been learning such things as: singing meditation, musical instruments, candle making, and gardening (digging for beetles...yum!). While you wouldn’t call these communal activities, the team has involved everyone by posting pics and videos, sharing their progress and experiences with the group. This has encouraged a community of learners actively sharing and engaging with their coworkers.</p><ul><li><strong>Quarantine Q’s</strong></li></ul><p>One of our culture warriors has taken to the company Slack channel with a bunch of weekly ‘Quarantine Questions’ - ranging from downright whack to ‘hmm, that’s pretty interesting!’ These questions spur on discussion and get everyone chatting and tagging each other - they’re also a good laugh too. A couple of the latest questions were: “If you could be another Honeypotter for a month, who would it be and why?” and “In what ways will you be good to yourself this weekend ;) ?” It’s a nice way to break our workdays and remind us of the reason we love our workplace: the people. </p><ul><li><strong>Yoga sessions</strong></li></ul><p>Yoga!? Who cares. Just kidding. Some of our more flexible folk have been teeing up virtual yoga sessions during the lunch breaks; it’s a unique way of engaging and sharing similar interests (now you’ve got a good excuse not to stare at those pixelated faces) </p><ul><li><strong>German coffee breaks</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes it’s nice to speak in a foreign language (or so I hear). We’re a very multinational group; many of us aren’t from Germany and so need a little time to practise the mother tongue. We’ve been using our coffee breaks to brush up with others - it’s not just German we’re trying to learn! Coffee breaks are also held in Italian, French and Spanish! Ooh la la.  </p><ul><li><strong>Deep Talks</strong></li></ul><p>At the beginning of the quarantine days, one of our much-loved Honeypotters, realising our need for deeper connections during these times, started a deep-talk session. It’s a small-group format where the moderator asks thoughtful questions to individuals in the group who, after answering, pass those questions on to another participant. You could make this format as light or deep as you want, though the benefit of digging beneath the surface is that it encourages vulnerability and an environment of sharing which naturally builds deeper bonds between people. Don’t know where to start? Here’s a question <a target='_blank' href='https://conversationstartersworld.com/random-question-generator/'>generator</a> to get your gears turning ;)  </p><ul><li><strong>Workshops</strong></li></ul><p>There is always much more we can learn in times of crisis and it’s best to share that knowledge around with the team and wider-company. Holding virtual workshops is a great way to get the team engaged with some of the skills and practices they’ll need moving forward. We’ve had workshops on remote communication, delivering feedback and on self-awareness, priming the team for the weeks ahead. </p><p>The idea is to keep the social interaction density high using a combination of these mini formats since they serve as the pillars of your company’s identity. Secretly we are all dying for a chance to connect with our co-workers and these activities allow us to do just that. For the most part, people will jump in and start these activities and conversations themselves! Also, don’t think these activities must go company-wide either, start with your team and maybe divide some of the social responsibilities around and let the group decide!</p><br /><h3 id='deal-with-isolation'>Deal with isolation</h3><p>We’ve talked about a bunch of different and creative ways you can bring the team together and enhance participation - but what about the other side? What can you do when team members are struggling to connect and are slowly drifting away from our team efforts?</p><p>Our friends over at GitLab sum it up nicely: “Prevention is a team sport. <strong>Leaders must work to establish a workplace culture that empowers rather than restricts</strong>, managers must be proactive in sensing the signs of mental strain, and team members must feel comfortable surfacing issues while they are still manageable.” - <a target='_blank' href='https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/'>GitLab</a></p><p>You may have your suspicions already - it’s not rocket science, and most of us can tell when a team member is falling behind or disengaging, and it’s even more apparent when working remotely. It’s not the time to be losing valued talent (it never is), those developers who are disengaged are much more likely to pack up shop and look elsewhere. According to a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kornferry.com/press/breaking-boredom-job-seekers-jumping-ship-for-new-challenges-in-2018-according-to-korn-ferry-survey'>Korn Ferry</a> survey, boredom is the top reason - 33% of respondents - for professionals changing jobs. </p><p>So let’s say you’ve been caught in the whirlwind of crisis management and haven’t had time to gauge every individual coworker. There are a few things you might want to look for to identify the signs early before you risk losing a valuable member of your team.</p><h3 id='signs-of-employee-disengagement'>Signs of employee disengagement</h3><ul><li>Missed deadlines (Can I get an extension?...)</li><li>They stop offering input</li><li>Their relationships with colleagues change</li><li>Work hours and break times are constantly changing (lack of structure)</li><li>There are more ‘sick’ breaks than usual</li><li>There’s a lack of  social participation </li><li>They are less likely to offer their opinion</li><li>They don’t want to commit to long-term projects</li><li>They’re late to meetings or skips them entirely</li></ul><p>It may seem like we’ve listed a bunch of reasons why you wouldn’t want this employee on your team, but that’s not the case at all. We all suffer from demotivation and feelings of isolation; there could be a number of reasons that feed into these types of behaviours. The obvious would be the current situation of the world, it’s understandable why someone would feel demotivated at work when so much else is happening at home and abroad. </p><p>Remember this is a teammate who is struggling and doesn’t need someone to tell them off. The best you can do is jump on a 1-on-1 call with the person and see if you can uncover the reasons behind their lack of motivation and isolation. What’s their day-to-day like? How’s working from home? <strong>You want to address these issues as soon as you can and provide support so that this doesn’t snowball into a more significant problem</strong>. Everything hinges on the quality of your relationship with your individual teammates. If it’s low, you’re going to need to start building rapport with them and invest time coaching them through and out the other side. Or take notes from <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/monsterculture/how-we-keep-the-team-spirit-high-in-180-home-offices-4fdfaef2d34d'>our friends at mySugr</a>, who benefit from sending weekly and bi-weekly health surveys to see how their employees are doing which enable them to make quick changes going forward. </p><p>The best time to stop burnout and isolation is now - before you even reach a point of distress. Our friends over at Gitlab suggest managers to encourage healthy ‘routines’ which proactively help reduce mental strain and potential isolation. Here are some of their recommendations:</p><ul><li>Set clear boundaries between work and home</li><li>Take a vacation day</li><li>Take a “mental health day” to lower your stress (spend time outdoors, exercise)</li><li>Know when to take a break</li><li>Put a break reminder on your computer (to ensure you do take those breaks!)</li><li>Switch off when you&#39;re away from work</li><li>Don&#39;t suffer in silence</li><li>Don&#39;t go straight to work after you wake up (try and have some ‘me’ time beforehand)</li><li>Remove Slack from your smartphone or at the very least, turn off notifications for it</li><li>Keep each other accountable. If someone in a different time zone should be asleep, tell them</li><li>Use your Slack status to share a message with the team that you are unavailable</li></ul><br /><h3 id='provide-feedback-often'>Provide Feedback Often</h3><p>I know it may not seem like feedback belongs here, but trust me, it does! Your team will be familiar in an environment where they receive feedback daily - instantly in some cases! In the vacuum of remote work, which is a completely new way of working for many, <a target='_blank' href='https://remote.co/5-tips-for-providing-feedback-to-remote-workers/'>uncertainty can rise</a>. This combination of anxiety and the unknown can lead your colleagues up to the doorstep of imposter syndrome. Without affirmation (positive or negative) members will be hesitant towards action. </p><p>Regular feedback lets your team know where they are positioned, calms those worry-warts and doesn’t leave anything up to surprise (making your job a whole lot easier). We recommend weekly reviews to catch up on how everyone is going and see what the future holds. Of course, you’ll have some guns on your team who can bust through anything with complete autonomy and don’t need you on their backs like a doting mother. But there will certainly be others who are more comfortable with traditional work environments and may need a little more ‘hand-holding’ if you catch my drift.  </p><p><strong>Honeypot’s guide to online performance reviews</strong></p><p>Yes, you might find a remote performance review awkward or off-putting for a number of reasons, but it’s time to embrace the change and get on with it. Here’s our method to holding a 360 review, which has actually been rather successful, and will hopefully cut down on some of those cringey moments and awkward silences. </p><p>First, have a very clear structure and agenda like this example we have outlined below:</p><p><strong>1. Employee’s self-review feedback</strong>If someone seems overly self-critical ask them to provide an example of something they are proud of (this is a common problem for high-achievers). If they can’t give one, why not? And try and find ways to help that coworker feel achievement and contribution.On the flip side, if they are very self-confident, ask them about what they could have done better. </p><p><strong>2. Employee’s feedback on leadership (that’s you) and the company</strong>People often need a push with this one, since we tend to shy away from giving criticism to our manager to their face (no kidding!). So do your best to encourage honesty and openness. If they aren&#39;t saying something directly, point out some areas yourself and ask them for their comments. </p><p><strong>3. Feedback from employee’s peers</strong> As you share the feedback, focus on behaviours, not personality, and draw connections between what they’ve said about themselves and what others had to say on the same subject. Does anything differ? If so, why is there a difference? Ask the employee which parts of the feedback resonate the most and why.</p><p><strong>4. Manager&#39;s feedback of things done well and improvements</strong></p><p><strong>5. Finish with the key takeaways</strong> </p><p>It’s important for them to arrive at a final narrative with at least two things they can be really proud of and the top areas they feel they need to improve in.</p><p>Differences between remote performance reviews and in-office onces aren’t drastic. The most important takeaway is; the agenda should be defined and structured, being the best defence against awkward situations and silences. </p><h2 id='3-how-to-show-appreciation-for-your-remote-team'>3. How to show appreciation for your remote team</h2><p>We show appreciation to our colleagues when they demonstrate hard work or go beyond set expectations. But sometimes we can overlook what others have done or achieved because we’ve been busy course-correcting and trying to navigate to easier times. What we need to be reminded of is that appreciation and praise are the champions of high performing, highly-engaged teams. <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.smarp.com/employee-engagement-8-statistics-you-need-to-know'>According to Hubspot</a>, 69% of employees said they’d work harder if they were better appreciated. So <strong>don’t let that good work go unnoticed</strong> - high quality recognition will benefit them and you in the long run. </p><h3 id='how-to-recognise-and-reward-your-remote-team'>How to Recognise and Reward Your Remote Team</h3><p>In the office recognition almost happens naturally, we see someone working hard or notice a change and can immediately address it. But in the online space, we’ve got a few more hurdles to jump through to ensure our teams are feeling seen. </p><p><strong>1. Implement an Employee Recognition Program</strong></p><p>Yes, it’s obvious, but still needs to be said: get the organisation on a HR platform that has built-in employee recognition features, and if you’re already on one, make the most of those features. <a target='_blank' href='https://officevibe.com/'>Officevibe</a> does a great job when it comes to tracking employee satisfaction, recording wins, and sharing gratitude. Some platforms like 15Five can be integrated into Slack and other chat apps to make it easy for public displays of gratitude. At Honeypot, we have a dedicated company channel for sharing individual and team wins, and we can definitely see how it improves comradery and good vibes all around. </p><p>Most of the organisations we’ve come across are using one of the following employee recognition programs: </p><ul><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.15five.com/'>15 Five</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.motivosity.com/index.html'>Motivosity</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.kudos.com/'>Kudos</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.fond.co/'>Fond</a></li></ul><p><strong>2. Offer Remote Career Development Opportunities</strong></p><p>Try to provide the same opportunities afforded inside the office to the remote workplace. For example, you might have mentorship and coaching programs or educational activities; bring them online! Don’t hold back just because the future is uncertain, workers still want access to career growth opportunities. This might mean a bit of creativity but there’s plenty on offer now that the majority of workshops and conferences have been shifted online. <strong>Giving employees opportunities to demonstrate their abilities and strengthen their knowledge is key to their success</strong>, and it’s a great way to bring up your team’s performance. At Honeypot we have a yearly budget for learning and development opportunities, so that employees can choose where they want to direct those allocated resources.</p><p><strong>3. Help your team jazz up their home offices</strong></p><p>Sitting in our pyjamas sipping home-brewed coffee is one great benefit of remote work, yet there is one major disadvantage we tend to overlook: the lack of technical resources we have available at home. There are a bunch of us out here hunched over, squinting at our tiny laptop screens. If you have the resources, create a budget for home offices so that team members can enjoy a few of the office comforts like cushioned chairs, webcams, monitors, toilet paper, mousepads, pasta, printers and all the other equipment which makes our work easier. The money you spend on improving your worker’s experiences will help them feel included, cared for, and turn them into a much more productive lot. Remember one extra monitor can double the output of an office worker! ← That’s a made-up fact by the way, so don’t go spreading it around. </p><br /><h3 id='how-to-show-appreciation'>How to show appreciation</h3><p>Recognition is only a piece of the puzzle. A broad thank-you announcement can also be a little impersonal, especially in remote situations. Reinforce your gratitude with individualised gifts; this extra bit of effort has a dramatic effect. It doesn’t have to be something fancy, it might be as simple as take-out lunch, and you’ll immediately notice the difference. </p><p>Here are some perks we’ve thought up which you might consider offering your remote people to make them feel included and valued: </p><ul><li>Care packages (snacks, toilet paper, etc.)</li><li>Office furniture (cushioned chairs, standing desks)</li><li>Birthday cards </li><li>Growth opportunities (conferences, workshops, online education)</li><li>Merchandise </li><li>Home fitness equipment</li></ul><p>You get the idea. And if this seems like too much to juggle, why not save yourself the hassle and instead give your team a monthly allowance so they can do the spiffing themselves.</p><p>Efforts of appreciation go a long way in keeping teams engaged and autonomous, they also keep your online culture attractive to current and future employees. </p><br /><h2 id='4-how-to-measure-remote-team-engagement'>4. How to measure remote team engagement</h2><p>Everything we’ve discussed so far has been about strengthening bonds between team members and encouraging engagement. But how do we know what’s working? Here are some ways you can measure the effectiveness of your engagement strategies. </p><h3 id='performance-tools-again'>Performance tools… again</h3><p>We touched on some of the HR tools you can use for tracking recognition and rewarding employees. These same tools can also record team engagement across periods of time. Project management tools can do the same for performance. It’s going to be helpful to have data on your side when identifying performance metrics and levels of satisfaction. This way you’ll be able to clearly see the issues and how well your team is engaged to better inform your management style. </p><h3 id='measure-output-not-input'>Measure output, not input</h3><p>Often the loudest voices on a team are usually doing the least, there’s always a lot of activity but it’s a bit murky when it comes to results. Focus on the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/measure-output-not-input-1/'>output</a> of your remote team members, the number of tickets closed or commits they’ve had over a period of time - this is a much better metric of engagement than the number of times you’ve seen them post in the team slack channel. </p><h3 id='ask-your-team-for-feedback'>Ask your team for feedback!</h3><p>Want to know if your team is engaged? Ask them! This will be the quickest way to gauge how your team is feeling. Anonymous surveys are a great way to gather feedback and suggestions,or even better, use regular 1-on-1 sessions to monitor and evaluate the team’s engagement. One to one usually works the best as people will tend to be more open about how they feel. Sure, you might have already organised a few of these, so you know what it’s all about - I’ll just say these two things; you should use these sessions for more than just talking shop; and how if you approach these sessions lazy and unprepared don’t expect much to come of them. Here’s more on hosting <a target='_blank' href='https://soapboxhq.com/blog/management-skills/1-on-1-meeting-tips-remote-managers'>1-on-1 sessions</a> as a remote manager.</p><p>Also, look to the traditional ways of gathering team feedback: performance reviews, 360’s and self-evaluations. If your team is committed to success they will be honest and quickly point to areas which need improvement, in others and in yourself. Peer reviews and self-evaluations provide great metrics to measure the engagement of particular members. And as we suggested earlier, make this a regular thing! Don’t prolong uncertainty in times like this, if someone is struggling to adapt, tell them and offer advice, don’t wait for a quarterly review. </p><h3 id='pulse-surveys'>Pulse Surveys</h3><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/employee/what-is-employee-pulse-survey/'>Pulse surveys</a> are a popular method of quickly measuring employee feedback. They are essentially short multiple-choice questionnaires which can be used to gauge employee’s reactions for decision making and employee experience. It’s a great way to bring the team along with you when making crucial decisions on employee engagement. Even simple questions like, ‘who’s interested in X or Y’ or ‘how much value does Z-activity bring?’ are great starting points.</p><p>All of your efforts towards increasing engagement are lost if your team doesn’t actually want to do the suggested thing. For example, some of our teams here at Honeypot love to get into technical debates, while other teams just want to shoot the breeze and play some Friday night trivia. We need to be aware of these differences when assessing our methods of team participation. </p><br /><h2 id='engaging-remote-engineering-teams'>Engaging remote engineering teams</h2><p>Despite the increased efficiency gains and uptake in employee autonomy delivered by remote teams, there are structural weaknesses when it comes to engagement and socialisation. We asked this question in the very beginning: how can we continue to build relationships in our new online workplace? The answer is: by keeping social interaction density high, and getting creative in the ways which we participate as a team. We’ve listed a bunch of ways you can do that above - now it’s time to implement them! </p><p>Thanks for reading! </p><h3 id='here-are-the-other-parts-to-this-series'>Here are the other parts to this series:</h3><p><strong>Part 1:</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/source-screen-developers-remotely/'>How to Source and Screen Developer Remotely</a></p><p><strong>Part 2:</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/interview-hire-developers-remotely/'>How to Interview Developers Remotely</a></p><p><strong>Part 3:</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/onboard-developers-remotely/'>How to Onboard Developers Remotely</a></p><p><strong>Part 4:</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/managing-teams-remotely/'>How to Manage Remote Developer Teams</a></p>",

      "contents": "<p>We’ve faced and overcome a whole range of challenges presented to us by Covid-19 and finally adjusted to our ‘new normal’. However, <strong>what we don’t have to accept as the ‘new normal’ is the inability to relocate abroad.</strong> While there are many processes that aren’t working as usual, and there are limitations when applying for visas, there may be more ways around them than you think. </p><p>Let’s get some clarity on these changes and take a look at the current status. Here are the eight most frequently asked questions when it comes to relocating to Germany (whether you are still abroad or already here) during Covid-19.</p><br /><h2 id='i-currently-live-abroad'>I currently live abroad</h2><p>You might have just signed your new work contract, applied for your visa and were ready to relocate, but the embassies and borders suddenly closed before you could leave. This is quite frustrating - but there are still some things you can do:</p><h3 id='1-i-have-received-a-visa-but-am-having-trouble-leaving-my-country-what-should-i-do'>1. I have received a visa, but am having trouble leaving my country. What should I do?</h3><p>Make sure to observe the current local situation in your home country and check regularly if there are any border or flight updates.In Germany and other European countries, there are many restrictions placed on those entering. Despite the restrictions, <strong>it is still possible to relocate to Germany if you have a valid Visa D and a compelling reason for entering</strong>, for example, you are filling an important IT position.If you do have a Visa D and a compelling reason, here’s what you should do:</p><ul><li>Contact the airlines and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bundespolizei.de/Web/DE/Service/Leichte-Sprache/leichtesprache_node.html;jsessionid=4962C7DF89461B7CCD8488D8EB186E33.1_cid297'>federal police force</a> in Germany beforehand and check with them about your travel possibilities.</li><li>Request a letter from your company which clarifies the urgency of your relocation.  </li><li>Bear in mind that once you relocate, you will need to stay two weeks in quarantine (when relocating from a Non-EU country).</li></ul><br /><h3 id='2-what-should-i-do-if-i-cant-book-an-embassy-appointment'>2. What should I do if I can’t book an embassy appointment?</h3><p>Most embassies are closed or operating in a limited capacity, so there are few available appointments - or perhaps no appointments at all. Here’s what you can do:</p><ul><li>Regularly check the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en'>German embassy website</a> for updates on when they’ll be accepting applications. It seems like some embassies are starting to re-open and are already offering appointments.</li><li>You can use this time to prepare the correct and necessary paperwork for the appointment and application - translated documents and degree recognition being the most important elements. </li><li>Chances are there’s a backlog of applications already, so visa processing time could take a little longer than usual. </li></ul><p>It’s frustrating when you’re stuck in limbo and unable to move as you planned. Nevertheless, <strong>you can use the time for reading and researching about your new destination</strong>, searching for a suitable apartment or even start learning some of the local language — try and get a head start!  </p><br /><h2 id='ive-arrived-in-germany'>I’ve arrived in Germany</h2><p>It’s challenging starting this new chapter of your life during these uncertain times while being far from family and friends. And now, given the lockdown, you’re worried that bureaucratic processes have become unreliable. Don’t worry, there are still some ways we can figure it all out! :)</p><h3 id='3-can-i-still-do-my-city-registration'>3. Can I still do my city registration?</h3><p>If you just moved to Germany and haven’t had the chance to register yourself to obtain the famous “Anmeldung”, you can still do that! <strong>Most of the city registrations are currently only assigning appointments for urgent cases</strong>. Since you just relocated and need to get registered in order to receive your Tax ID to get paid, this is most likely considered urgent.Depending on the city, you can get in contact with the office via email or some are even taking calls. They will give you the next possible appointment. Here is what you should prepare beforehand:</p><ul><li>The confirmation form from your landlord</li><li>The Anmeldung form (this form is different for each city registration, so type into Google: <em>Bürgeramt/city registration + city xy + Anmeldung form</em> in order to find the necessary form. For example, <em>Bürgeramt + Berlin + Anmeldung form</em>)</li></ul><br /><h3 id='4-what-can-i-do-when-my-foreign-agency-appointment-gets-cancelled-or-my-visa-expires'>4. What can I do when my Foreign Agency appointment gets cancelled or my visa expires?</h3><p>When the Foreign Agencies closed to the public back in March, they also cancelled most of the appointments. However, <strong>they’re still in operation and issuing confirmations on visa status’ and extensions for probationary certificates</strong>. In Berlin, they have made online registration possible for those with cancelled appointments or expired Visas — check if this is available in your city.</p><p>We are seeing a few Foreign Agencies slowly opening and they’re starting to invite applicants for appointments, starting with the most urgent cases (for example, those with an expired visa).</p><p>Meanwhile, here&#39;s what you can do:</p><ul><li>Check for updates from your responsible Foreign Agency to find out how you can proceed.</li><li>You’ll  probably need to email your work permit application to the Foreign Agency beforehand.</li><li>After the Foreign Agency checks your documents they will most probably send you an appointment invitation letter or a probationary certificate</li></ul><p>Don’t worry if you haven’t received a new appointment after contacting the Foreign Agency. They have a huge backlog of applications and will get back to you as soon as they can offer you an appointment slot. Your visa will remain valid until the appointment (if you sent the necessary documents to the Foreign Agency).</p><br /><h3 id='5-what-should-i-do-if-i-came-on-a-jobseekers-visa-to-germany-and-found-a-new-job'>5. What should I do if I came on a Jobseeker’s visa to Germany and found a new job?</h3><p>That’s great! For obtaining your work permit, you will need to follow the same steps as above, but:</p><ul><li>Keep in mind that you can only submit the documents to the Foreign Agency <ins>if you are already registered in that city</ins>.</li><li>The processing of the documents might take some time. Depending on the Foreign Agency, it can take one week or up to one month. Make sure you adjust your starting date with your new employer.</li></ul><br /><h3 id='6-i-want-to-change-my-employer-how-do-i-do-this'>6. I want to change my employer. How do I do this?</h3><p>If you have worked less than two years on your Blue Card or you are obtaining a regular work permit, <strong>you will need to inform the Foreign Agency about your job change</strong>. Check the information on the homepage of your responsible Foreign Agency to see how they are dealing with applications (most probably through email). This is what you’ll probably have to send them:</p><ul><li>A scan of your passport</li><li>Your job contract and job description from your employer</li><li>The resignation letter from your previous employer</li></ul><p>You should receive a confirmation email or letter in the post which will allow you to start your new job. </p><br /><h3 id='7-what-should-i-do-if-i-have-been-laid-off'>7. What should I do if I have been laid off?</h3><p>We are sorry to hear that! </p><p>You will have three to six months (depending on the Foreign Agency - please check!) to search for a new job. You will also need to inform the responsible Foreign Agency immediately about the change of your work status. They might ask you to send them the following as proof:</p><ul><li>Proof of Health Insurance during unemployment</li><li>The resignation letter</li><li>A recent bank statement</li></ul><p>Also, feel free to reach out to Honeypot’s Talent Success Team (if you are a developer!) - they’ll be happy to support you finding a new job.</p><br /><h3 id='8-what-does-kurzarbeitmean-and-does-it-impact-my-visa-status'>8. What does “Kurzarbeit”mean and does it impact my visa status?</h3><p>Due to the impact on the economy, businesses registered in German have been afforded the opportunity to apply for <em>Kurzarbeitergeld</em> which means ‘short-time work allowance’.</p><p>Eligible companies can apply for the allowance to support them if they have been forced to reduce the working hours of their employees. </p><p>Since employees are only paid according to the amount of reduced work, this short-time allowance is intended to cushion the financial hardship of lower wages. Good news for you: <strong>Kurzarbeit has no impact on your visa status.</strong></p><br /><h2 id='takeaways'>Takeaways</h2><p>In a nutshell, it might not seem like the easiest time to relocate and settle down in a new city, but <strong>it’s still possible to get the crucial bureaucratic things done</strong> (And don’t forget: <em>Always wear a mask to appointments!</em>).</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about the relocation process to Germany, watch the recording of our recent webinar: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8F4FlHapxM'><em>Relocating to Germany in times of Corona.</em></a></p><p>Here’s what you’ll learn:</p><ul><li>How the general relocation process to Germany works</li><li>Best practices for how you can still manage relocation despite the current circumstances</li><li>...and our answers to live questions asked by the attendees</li></ul><p>Check it out over at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8F4FlHapxM'>Honeypot Talks!</a> </p>",

      "contents": "<p>Congratulations! You’ve received an invitation to interview for your dream developer job. However, there’s a catch: it’s taking place over a computer screen, and because of this there are a few things you need to do differently to prepare. </p><p>It may be more difficult for some of us to look at the camera and talk rather than communicate face-to-face; however, you will find that video interviews, independent of location and time, provide great convenience. Check out our recommendations to ace your video interview!</p><h2 id='1-take-care-with-preparation-and-set-up'>1. Take care with preparation and set-up</h2><p>Your set-up affects your credibility! Keep in mind that <strong>your set-up is a reflection of your personality, professionality, and will contribute significantly to your overall impression</strong>. You probably think “yes, of course, I know how to create a perfect set-up for the interview,” but do you really? Some candidates receive rejections after their first video interview because of their set-ups. If you really want to have a hassle-free video interview, you should pay attention to these points below: </p><h3 id='use-a-laptop'>Use a laptop</h3><p>First things first; do not enter the interview platforms through your phone, since a horizontal video is usually preferred and holding your phone will inevitably lead to shaking. Use your laptop and <strong>have a clean desk</strong> without any distractions. </p><h3 id='dress-the-part'>Dress the part</h3><p>Even though it is a video interview, you should get dressed as if going to an in-person interview to create a professional attitude and mindset. Don’t be like the guy we heard about from a recruiter, who showed up to his interview shirtless! Even though he had extensive tech knowledge, it was overshadowed by how awkward the situation was for the recruiter. Okay, you probably won’t show up to your interview shirtless, but try to dress professionally - your outfit can indicate how serious you are about the position. </p><h3 id='maintain-good-posture'>Maintain good posture</h3><p>This is critical! Don’t slouch on the couch; try to sit upright but relaxed, and set your laptop or computer at the edge of your desk so the recruiter can see your hand gestures as you talk. </p><h3 id='have-a-clean-background'>Have a clean background</h3><p>Your setting should be clean and neat. A <strong>messy background may symbolize disorganized or poorly structured behaviours</strong> and believe me, nobody wants to see your clothes hung to dry. If you like, you can add some items that show your hobbies, like a guitar or your library. It could even create a talking point during the interview! </p><h3 id='ensure-your-environment-is-quiet'>Ensure your environment is quiet</h3><p>The prerequisite for any video call is that you can hear each other easily. You should make sure there will be no interruptions. If there is a lot of environmental noise, the interview would be disturbing and frustrating for both parties. </p><h3 id='use-headphones'>Use headphones</h3><p>It’s obvious when someone isn’t using headphones in a call. You can usually hear yourself as an echo which is distracting, and you don’t want this to happen to the recruiter during an interview. Use them, and test them out beforehand through a program like Skype, which you can do for free through their audio and video settings. </p><h3 id='pause-notifications'>Pause notifications</h3><p>Muting your phone is just the beginning – consider other things that will distract you during the interview. Close internet tabs and email notifications that can distract you. Notification sounds might make you appear less focused and engaged. </p><p>Recruiters will see how seriously you take the opportunity by taking the time to create the best possible environment for your video interview. Following these tips will make you seem more ambitious, enthusiastic and make it easier to listen to you. </p><h2 id='2-practice-practice-practice'>2. Practice, practice, practice</h2><p>It’s possible that your first few video calls might make you feel uncertain about several aspects, such as where to look, where to place your hands or how to adjust your voice volume. However, it’s easy to find solutions to all of these by practising beforehand. </p><p>Have a mock-interview with your friend or a colleague and record it. If you are on the Honeypot platform, <strong>ask to schedule one with your talent success advisor</strong>. You&#39;ll get a more precise idea of how to make an impression during the real deal. Analyse your recording and repeat this process until you are satisfied with the result. A bit further below we’ve listed some things to watch out for.</p><h2 id='3-your-first-impression-matters'>3. Your first impression matters</h2><p>Recruiters are mostly going to <strong>remember how you made them feel</strong> rather than your exact sentences. Your first impression starts when you log in on the interview platform. You can count it as a “waiting room”. It all matters: whether you are late or on time (show up early like you would in an in-person interview), what your interview set-up looks like, or whether your audio and video is working or not. </p><p>Show your confidence not only with your words but also with <strong>your attitude, body language and non-verbal communication</strong>. Your tone, the speed and the rhythm in your voice are essential. Therefore, try to be mindful of how you are coming across. Also, don’t forget that your tone of voice is more optimistic when you are smiling! Here are some other things to be mindful of:</p><ul><li><strong>Internet quality</strong> - How is your video quality? Does the interviewer only see you as pixels, or are your facial expressions clearly recognizable? Ensure you have a stable internet connection in this case. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Video lag</strong> - Do you let the interviewer finish their sentence or are you interrupting the conversation? Be mindful of audio lag which is common when communicating via video.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Engagement</strong> - Ensure your facial expressions are a little bigger than usual; smile and nod and use hand gestures clearly. It’s important for them to see that you’re engaged. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Good lighting</strong> - How many of you have had video calls with friends or colleagues but there was dim light and you could hardly see their faces? Make sure there is light coming from the front rather than behind. If your face is well-lit, the video quality looks better which contributes to your sense of professionalism. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Eye contact</strong> - Since this is not an in-person interview, the screen is the eye of the recruiter and the only way to create eye contact is by looking into the camera. Therefore, try to speak directly into the camera.</li></ul><h2 id='4-have-a-preparation-worksheet-next-to-you'>4. Have a preparation worksheet next to you</h2><p>Use the advantage of not being seen properly and prepare a cheatsheet! It may contain some of the key points that you would like to mention or written prompts for the questions that you would like to ask. You can put the document on the screen at the same time as the interview by splitting your screen.</p><p>Since you have access to a cheatsheet, rambling will be less likely. Keep in mind that rambling could be a red flag to a recruiter since it communicates disorganized thinking. If you realise that you are rambling about topics that are not related to the answer, try to stay calm and check some of your key points on your worksheet - the interviewer will probably not notice! </p><h2 id='5-kindness-always-wins'>5. Kindness always wins</h2><p>Don’t forget to thank the interviewer for their time at the end of the call. Sending a <strong>follow-up “thank you” email</strong> on the same day of the interview would be appropriate. Prepare a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-an-interview-thankyou-note-an-email-template'>tailor-made thank you note</a> that:</p><ul><li>States your appreciation for the interviewer&#39;s time and the information received about the company. </li><li>Expresses thanks to the interviewer for their patience if there were any technical difficulties.</li><li>Links to articles or work that you mentioned during the interview.</li><li>Avoids being too casual and has no spelling mistakes.</li></ul><h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><p>In recent months, video interviews have become more important for many companies, especially if they are hiring international talent. They come across many developers on a computer screen every day, so making a good first impression is paramount.</p><p>Ensure that you pay attention to your set-up and practise showing that you’re engaged. This way, you will feel a little more comfortable and secure during your online video interview. And remember that success is in your hands and not in an unattainable position. </p><p>We wish you good luck in your video interviews! 🙂</p>",

      "id": "2020-07-21-reverse-recruitment",
      "contents": "<p>Recruiting tech talent is the main challenge for many HR managers and recruiters around the world, and it’s about to get even more challenging. In the coming years, the number of available tech jobs is expected to largely increase. At the same time, the pool of qualified developers will decrease – <strong>by 2030, we anticipate <a target='_blank' href='https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/03/global-competition-for-technology-workers-costa.htm'>a global shortage</a> of more than 85 million tech workers!</strong></p><p>For this reason, it’s more important than ever to prepare. Even companies that already have a healthy pipeline of candidates should be proactive in improving their recruitment strategy to remain competitive, and reverse recruitment is the way to do it. We’ve listed the most important performance indicators in tech recruitment you should be looking at, how to measure them and how to improve them using reverse recruitment.</p><h2 id='what-is-reverse-recruitment'>What is reverse recruitment?</h2><p>As the name suggests, <strong>reverse recruitment is a recruitment model where companies apply to candidates instead of the other way around</strong> - literally reversing the recruitment process. Reverse recruitment is usually used on a platform (like Honeypot) and is most commonly used in tech recruitment, as the scarcity of tech talent asks for innovative ways to attract them. </p><p>To make this recruitment model work for companies, developers are screened upfront to understand their intentions and sense of urgency, and to avoid unresponsiveness which is a common obstacle when sourcing developers yourself. How many times have you sourced the perfect candidate on Linkedin, sent them a personalised and convincing message, only to be left on read? Developers receive these messages multiple times a day – often for jobs that they feel don’t match what they’re looking for – and they’re tired of them. </p><p>As reverse recruitment puts the developer in a central spot by letting companies apply to them, <strong>the majority of developers use these platforms over other channels</strong>. </p><h2 id='using-reverse-recruitment-for-hiring'>Using reverse recruitment for hiring</h2><p>There are a range of metrics you can use to measure the success of your recruitment strategy. Here we&#39;ll focus on three in particular that can be optimised with reverse recruitment.</p><h3 id='time-to-fill'>Time-to-fill</h3><p><a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/time-to-hire/'>There are two KPIs</a> regarding the time it takes to fill a position, which are often used interchangeably, but do have a significant difference: time-to-hire and time-to-fill:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-to-hire</strong> measures the time from the moment the developer is sourced to the moment they accepted the offer.</li><li><strong>Time-to-fill</strong> measures the time the position opens to the moment the developer accepts the offer.</li></ul><p>Both indicators have a damaging impact when not managed properly. As for time-to-hire, there is absolutely no candidate that likes a long hiring process. <a target='_blank' href='https://yello.co/blog/recruiting-generation-z/'>17% of Gen Z job seekers</a> accept an offer less than a week after the first interview – so cutting down time-to-hire is key in attracting newbies in the workforce.</p><p><strong>A long time-to-hire might also result in losing high-quality developers</strong>, who get plenty of job offers and have accepted another one in the meantime. </p><p>As for time-to-fill, when you are taking a long time to get in touch with the right developers, know that by the time you know who to reach out to, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hirevue.com/blog/recruiting-kpis-5-types-of-metrics'>your competition has made them an offer</a>.) already. Not only that, but <strong>if you’re sourcing talent on sites like Linkedin, <a target='_blank' href='https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/Talent-passive-candidates-101.html'>they’re likely to be passive candidates</a></strong> and this can increase your time-to-fill even more.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>engineering positions have the highest time-to-fill compared to other departments</strong>. To put this in perspective, <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/faq-time-to-fill-hire'>the average time-to-fill</a> an engineering position is 62 days – sometimes even more. </p><p>A reverse recruitment strategy has a positive impact on both the time-to-hire and time-to-fill as you are approaching developers who are certainly looking for a new job. <strong>On Honeypot, we have seen companies reduce their time-to-hire from 50 days to 25 days</strong> – a 50% decrease!</p><h3 id='cost-per-hire'>Cost-per-hire</h3><p>Another important performance indicator is the cost-per-hire. The <strong>cost-per-hire measures <a target='_blank' href='https://www.talentlyft.com/en/resources/what-is-cost-per-hire'>how much it costs a company</a> to fill an open position</strong> and <a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/cost-per-hire/'>exists of many components</a> such as: </p><ul><li>advertising costs</li><li>recruitment software fees</li><li>salaries of in-house talent acquisition</li><li>salary and time spent of the people involved</li><li>employer branding activities</li><li>and sometimes relocation costs</li></ul><p>The cost-per-hire of a position <a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/cost-per-hire/'>is dependent on the seniority</a> of the role and the department. As there is an increased demand for tech talent, <strong>the cost-per-hire for engineering roles are among one of the highest</strong>, so it isn’t any wonder that companies aim to keep it as low as possible. However, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.smartrecruiters.com/resources/glossary/cost-per-hire/'>some experts advise</a> that to attract top talent and grow your company, you need to invest, and reducing your cost-per-hire to an all-time low limits the ability to do so. </p><p>A great way to reduce costs while maintaining a high quality of candidates is to focus on reducing the time-to-fill. The costs of an open position are often very well-hidden but can add a serious burden to a company&#39;s operational costs.</p><p>Let’s compare the cost-per-hire to the cost of an open tech position as these have the longest time-to-fill. </p><p>The <a target='_blank' href='https://insights.dice.com/employer-resource-center/calculating-the-cost-of-vacant-tech-positions/'>average costs of an open position</a> is estimated at €450 a day. </p><p>If you want to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ere.net/cost-of-vacancy-formulas-for-recruiting-and-retention-managers/'>calculate this more accurately</a>, you can do this by taking the salary for the position and divide this by 260 (the amount of working days in a year) and multiply by 2. </p><p>We’ll do the math for you, see below:</p><ul><li>A <strong>salary</strong> of <strong>€40,000</strong> results in a <strong>€308 cost per day.</strong></li><li>A <strong>salary</strong> of <strong>€60,000</strong> results in a <strong>€462 cost per day.</strong></li><li>A <strong>salary</strong> of <strong>€70,000</strong> results in a <strong>€538 cost per day.</strong></li></ul><p>These costs include a lack of productivity, the lack of business growth, possible overtime costs for other employees, and employee turnover based on increased work pressure. These aren&#39;t very visible on a financial sheet, but definitely have influence on your bottom line. </p><p>Let’s use this to calculate the costs for an open tech position. As mentioned above, <strong>the average amount of time to fill a tech position is 62 days</strong>. With a salary of €50,000 a year, the costs of this open position would be 384 x 62 = €23,808.</p><p>Using reverse recruitment can reduce the time-to-fill to 25 days. However, using reverse recruitment platforms often comes with a fee – on average 15% of the yearly salary of the candidate. However, it does work out better in the end.</p><h3 id='heres-an-example'>Here&#39;s an example</h3><p>Feel free to follow the steps with one of your open positions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Step one:</strong> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine you’re hiring a developer with a salary of €50,000. Remember to <strong>divide &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their salary</strong> by the number of working days in a year: 260.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, €50,000 ÷ 260 = 192</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Step two:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <strong>multiply this number</strong> by 2 (= 384)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Step three:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, using reverse recruitment can reduce the time-to-fill to 25 days, so:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;384 x 25 + 7500 (15% fee of yearly salary) =  €17,100! </p><p>This is a <strong>28% saving per hire – €6,708 to be precise</strong>. Imagine how much you could save by using reverse recruitment when you need to hire 10 developers! Try out the calculation for yourself with some of your open positions. </p><h3 id='number-of-qualified-candidates'>Number of qualified candidates</h3><p>This metric <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/qualified-candidates-recruiting-metrics'>measures how many candidates</a> that apply for the position are worth having an initial conversation with, meaning that they fulfill the primary requirements of the job. </p><p>For some companies the amount of applications might not be the problem, yet they still struggle to fill their tech positions. How much time have you spent sifting through countless applications, only to be left with few qualified candidates? And yes, going through large amounts of applications definitely impacts the time-to-fill as well. </p><p>There are multiple reasons for having <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/qualified-candidates-recruiting-metrics'>a low number</a> of qualified candidates, but here are two that often occur in tech recruitment:</p><p><strong>1. Tech knowledge</strong> </p><p>This is a common issue when recruiting for tech positions. <strong>Not every professional involved in recruitment has a technical background</strong>, so it can be quite difficult for a junior tech recruiter or sourcer to understand what it is that the hiring manager is looking for, leaving you with a lower number of qualified candidates. When using Honeypot as a reverse recruitment platform, you are assigned a Client Success Manager who is trained to help you select the right candidates. This is very beneficial for the less experienced tech recruiter who can use some additional guidance.</p><p><strong>2. Appealing job descriptions</strong> </p><p>Have you optimized your allocated resources to the source of hire and are you sure that your recruiters are sourcing the right developers? <strong>It makes sense to revise your job description and see if it is written in an appealing way for developers.</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://cult.honeypot.io/'>Check out .cult</a>, a new platform with content for developers to understand what is currently on their minds :) </p><p>You will increase the number of qualified candidates when you actively source developers, but as you already know – this takes time. For technical roles, niche channels like reverse recruitment prove to get the most qualified candidates. </p><p><strong>Reverse recruitment platforms allow you to use filters to ensure every developer you come across matches your primary requirements</strong>, increasing the number of qualified candidates to close to 100% when done right. This is especially interesting taking into consideration that requirements for tech jobs can be a bit more complex compared to other jobs!</p><h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s no secret that there are more barriers to hiring exceptional tech talent than in other professions, and as the scarcity of tech talent increases globally, every company should focus on optimising their tech recruitment metrics. </p><p>Whether your goal is to reduce time-to-fill, to increase your number of qualified candidates, or reduce your cost - reverse recruitment is the way to go!

What does employer branding mean and what comes with it?</h3><p>Employer branding is bigger and encompasses more than simply raising awareness for your brand or selling a brand proposition. Your employer branding should start within your company, in the culture and <strong>it should reach to every step in the employee lifecycle</strong>, from attracting talent to onboarding to development retention and even to the off-boarding stage. </p><p>It’s not just getting candidates in the pipeline — that’s a common misunderstanding. <strong>It’s about creating amazing experiences</strong> for your employees which they’ll never forget because employees are your best ambassadors. Employer branding is really about creating a great place to work internally and externally. </p><p><em>Check out our article on the <strong><a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/benefits-of-employer-branding/'>Benefits of Employer Branding</a></strong>.</em></p><h3 id='2-how-would-you-try-to-create-a-great-place-to-work-for-your-employees'>2. How would you try to create a great place to work for your employees?</h3><p>Before you jump into any crazy initiatives, make sure there is no misunderstanding between the management and the employees. This is really the first step: <strong>identifying if there are some issues there</strong>, maybe with trust or transparency, or maybe something is toxic. You need to discover the issues and address them before you can move the culture and brand in a direction that is positive. </p><p>Employer branding can only be lived if it’s lived and breathed by your own employees. From here, the next step is to <strong>do some brand discovery</strong>; define what the company means to the employees, what values does it have, and how does it treat people? And you need to go straight to the employees on this one. You can use surveys, 1-on-1’s and focus groups. </p><p>As an expert, it’s not always about creating a ‘brand’ identity but more about discovering it and helping to support and strengthen it. Work to celebrate the company’s uniqueness. </p><h3 id='3-how-important-is-it-to-have-a-dedicated-employer-branding-manager-what-should-they-be-in-charge-of'>3. How important is it to have a dedicated employer branding manager? What should they be in charge of?</h3><p>Obviously, in an ideal situation, it would be best for your company to have an employer branding manager but it’s not going to be possible for everyone. The majority of companies just don’t have the budget. That doesn’t mean they can’t work on the brand – there are plenty of smaller things that can be done without a budget for a dedicated person. </p><p>First of all, <strong>every employee can work as a branding expert if they have support and encouragement</strong>. There are very small startups out there with amazing employer branding because the people who work there are in love with the culture of that company. Start with little steps and eventually it will make a huge difference. </p><p>Employer branding is also going to be very important for your company in times of crisis — in those times the experiences of your employees can become front-page news, and that can make or break your branding. </p><h3 id='4-can-you-give-us-some-examples-of-internal-employer-branding-you-did--maybe-its-something-that-youre-proud-of'>4. Can you give us some examples of internal employer branding you did – maybe it&#39;s something that you&#39;re proud of?</h3><p>On Employee Appreciation Day (March 5th) we ran a very simple campaign, providing a hand-written note from the CEO to everyone in the company, expressing gratitude for all the hard work. It was something small but it went a long way to making people feel recognised and appreciated. </p><p>We also ran a brand ambassador program where people and influencers go out and spread the brand love to their peers. It doesn’t sound internal but all that external chatter about the brand and company actually fosters pride among the employees. And, of course, every employer branding manager has been put to the test in the last few months with this pandemic. <strong>There have been numerous opportunities to create lasting moments</strong>. This has mostly been around flexibility and treating employees well. </p><h3 id='5-how-can-you-create-moments-that-matter'>5. How can you create moments that matter?</h3><p>There are many opportunities for this in every stage of the employee lifecycle. Start by <strong>evaluating your employee journey</strong> from beginning to end and identify the points at which you can elevate the experience for your employees to a higher level. The employees of your company will have many ideas around this. So run workshops with the departments to get ideas for how employee branding can be improved. </p><p>One interesting idea that came out of the tech department was implementing a greeting/application message into the code of the website. Apparently developers have a tendency to check code on every website they visit or want to work with, so the message was a nice way to elevate that experience and help our company stand out. </p><p>Taking the recent example of COVID-19 and switching from the office to remote, we created some moments based around feelings of safety and security. It was important that our employees felt safe and were not rushed or pressured to work. If people felt unwell, they could immediately work from home; if there were issues with childcare or school, they could work from home. We took into account their personal circumstances with every decision. </p><p>We even had the IT department managing the transport of IT equipment (even chairs and screens) to all our employees’ homes. We wrote playbooks for how to deal with the situation, from explaining the preferred methods of communication and the tools we’ll be using. The communication strategy completely changed. </p><p>Firstly, we gave everyone a platform to communicate on and we started a newsletter from the management informing the company of decisions on a daily basis so everyone could read about how the business was working. So you can see, <strong>even in a crisis situation there are opportunities</strong>, and even in bad moments such as layoffs, which can be turned into a good moment. </p><p>AirBnB modelled this well. They had some extreme layoffs but it was handled extremely well, the exiting employees were given career counselling, laptops and additional payments to really help them on their way. </p><h3 id='6-how-can-people-handle-these-bad-moments-and-situations'>6. How can people handle these bad moments and situations?</h3><p>First of all, management and the stakeholders (HR and marketing) need to be educated on this stuff. It’s so easy for candidates to get the truth about a company from sites like Kununu and Glassdoor, so don’t bother ignoring it. If you have leadership on your side there is a lot that can be done to turn bad situations around. If you don’t, it’ll be an uphill battle. <strong>People need to understand that change is okay</strong>, but expectations need to be set. If you’re working to make a bad situation better it’s not going to happen in six months. It’s a long process and that should be clear. </p><h3 id='7-do-you-think-work-has-changed-for-the-good-what-does-it-mean-for-employer-branding'>7. Do you think work has changed for the good? What does it mean for employer branding?</h3><p><strong>What’s normal has absolutely changed</strong>. We’ve all seen how well remote work has been doing, there’s no denying that. And obviously, it’s a lot more decentralised — maybe spread across the country or continent. So this poses new challenges for employer branding. </p><p>It’s hard to say exactly what will happen as it’s only been a couple of months, but <strong>it seems like employer branding will probably become more hyperlocal</strong>. Performance marketing will be focused on local environments like certain streets or districts. What we can do is try to get ahead of this change and involve our employees in the future of the work-place. Run workshops, create task forces and get everyone involved in shaping their future work environments. </p><h3 id='8-how-would-you-try-to-engage-more-of-your-employees-to-take-part-in-employer-branding'>8. How would you try to engage more of your employees to take part in employer branding?</h3><p>In a company with a flat hierarchy, it’s going to be much easier compared to the traditional old-school corporate German structure. There will be fewer barriers and employees will be more comfortable sharing their experiences in public. <strong>We would suggest empowering and encouraging them to share brand love</strong>. Sometimes they want to get involved but need a bit of coaching. </p><p>A brand-bible is going to be a good place to start. It’ll explain what they can talk about, what they shouldn’t, what’s the tone of voice, and try to provide some social media examples for them to follow. With these structures, <strong>employees have more security and less uncertainty</strong> about how they can engage with the brand. And look, sometimes people will get involved without being asked — that’s great! You should be thanking them and doing everything you can to encourage and support them. </p><h3 id='9-what-key-marketing-channels-do-you-recommend-for-the-developertech-community'>9. What key marketing channels do you recommend for the developer/tech community?</h3><p>At the moment <strong>LinkedIn is working really well for reaching the tech community</strong>. We get far more engagement there, and as much as developers say they hate LinkedIn, they are still using it to find companies and connect with people. You’ve also got meetups which are very popular among techies, they love knowledge-exchange so making your brand present in those environments is a great opportunity. </p><p>Also, make yourselves visible on GitHub and AngelList — you can involve your own developers in this. Twitter is also very popular, but it’s working more for creative brands, so don’t go there to sell anything; it’s not going to land well if you do that.</p><h3 id='10-what-digital-tools-should-i-use-to-help-support-efforts-in-employer-branding-and-social-media'>10. What digital tools should I use to help support efforts in employer branding and social media?</h3><p>There are heaps of tools out there to support employer branding. But at the end of the day, <strong>it’s about what your main objective is</strong>. Do you want to create more brand awareness? Do you want to have more leads in the pipeline? Or is it about fostering a great company culture? </p><p>A good place to start is a company blog; we suggest Medium. It’s easy to implement and easy for your employees to share there. <strong>Developers are more interested in future projects</strong> and work than that other fluffy branding stuff which might work for your customers. Let your developers write about projects they are working on and speak to their peers. There are also a few things you can do internally. </p><p>For example, you could host little takeovers of the company Instagram.One of your employees could take the phone for the whole day and just share what the day is like working at your company. Employees tend to enjoy the content and talent can get some insights into the work-life of the company. </p><h3 id='11-is-employer-branding-more-of-a-communication-marketing-topic-or-a-hr-topic-who-should-be-in-the-lead'>11. Is employer branding more of a communication marketing topic or a HR topic? Who should be in the lead?</h3><p>You can’t do it without HR or marketing and communications because these departments will always be talking about the brand. Ideally, you’d be working with both departments, but in terms of where an employer banding expert would sit – probably towards the HR side. Whatever department, <strong>the most important thing is to onboard the stakeholders</strong> and have access to all those channels of branding because, without proper oversight, your employer brand can be destroyed in seconds. </p><h3 id='12-how-would-you-extend-employer-branding-to-new-staff-members-to-make-them-immediately-feel-part-of-the-team'>12. How would you extend employer branding to new staff members to make them immediately feel part of the team?</h3><p>As we said earlier, employee and <strong>candidate experience starts with the first contact</strong>, so make them feel part of the team at the very first stage. This could be when they are interviewed or signing the contract. There is so much potential to create a long-lasting impact in the pre-onboarding phase. From the time the contract is signed to the first day, it’s generally about six months. </p><p>Use this time to onboard them with the company culture and already help them create relationships and meet other team members. Sending them welcome packets and information will mean less time spent in the actual onboarding phase, which equals less money spent and a better-integrated employee. </p><h3 id='13-how-can-i-manage-the-step-from-company-values-to-a-believable-employer-brand'>13. How can I manage the step from company values to a believable employer brand?</h3><p>Given that the company values were developed in a process with the employees and colleagues, and given that they can identify with them, I would integrate the colleagues into my employer branding strategy. Find employee stories based on your corporate values and start communicating them. Encourage all employees to share the stories and perhaps <strong>tell their own story</strong> that is consistent with the values. The values must be reflected in all internal processes, for example by incorporating them into your recruitment or onboarding strategy. </p><p>If one of your values would be transparency, then act accordingly in your candidate experience and give honest feedback to candidates – tell them how they can develop. Also <strong>actively use the feedback you receive</strong> — no matter what platform — and try to work on it. Only if you live the values in all hierarchies will you be able to create a credible external brand to the outside world.</p><h3 id='14-how-can-i-convince-top-management-that-employer-branding-is-still-important-during-covid-19'>14. How can I convince top management that employer branding is still important during COVID-19?</h3><p>It is precisely in times of crises that the true character of a company becomes apparent. <strong>How does your company want to be remembered by employees and society?</strong> Employer branding experts can help to support top management in this crisis by keeping the employees&#39; perspective in mind. Treat your employees correctly. Giving them security, leadership and guidance is important but also listen to them. Do not focus on something external. External communication will follow when people, who are treated well, share their thoughts.</p><h3 id='15-how-can-you-make-the-difference-in-employer-branding-what-is-a-good-differentiator'>15. How can you make the difference in employer branding? What is a good differentiator?</h3><p>Your culture is the best differentiator, because culture is always unique, just as your employees and colleagues are unique. Start talking more about the people behind the company, their personalities, thoughts etc. than about the company itself. <strong>Show how people can make a difference</strong> in the company and how they can shape and contribute to it.</p><h3 id='16-whats-the-best-thing-a-company-does-if-nothing-else-to-improve-employer-branding'>16. What&#39;s the best thing a company does if nothing else to improve employer branding?</h3><p>Generally, I advise making sure your company culture and internal structures &amp; processes are on the right track before starting any employer branding efforts. If employees feel excluded, they will become vocal about this. So, make sure before starting any employer branding efforts that <strong>your company can shine from inside</strong> to the outside and fully live, breathe, and support your employer brand. </p><h3 id='17-how-do-i-do-employer-branding-when-there-are-only-very-few-vacancies'>17. How do I do employer branding when there are only very few vacancies?</h3><p>Employer Branding is not all only about recruiting. A great employer brand can <strong>help you to level up the whole HR lifecycle</strong> (Attraction, Onboarding, Retention/Development, and Offboarding). There are many great initiatives you can make. What about building up alumni relations? Or an engagement campaign that fosters internal pride? Just think outside the box and be creative. :) </p><h3 id='18-what-are-some-best-practices-for-reaching-tech-talent'>18. What are some best practices for reaching tech talent?</h3><p>Tech talent is super diverse. Besides being visible on relevant platforms such as LinkedIn, Github and Angelist, you can create a workshop with your current tech employees. This is how you get to know your local needs and create with them the differentiator for your organization. Moreover, <strong>they will feel engaged and empowered</strong> to contribute to the success of your branding initiatives. </p><h3 id='19-id-like-to-see-good-examples-from-companies'>19. I&#39;d like to see good examples from companies</h3><p>There are many good situational examples of employer branding during the COVID-19 pandemic. I personally liked how AirBnB handled the layoffs, or also how German retailers <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-crisis-communication-how-re-frame-your-employer-jarzak/'>re-framed some of its brand narratives</a> of ‘essential workers’ to ‘our heroes’. </p><p>A good example is also <a target='_blank' href='(https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)'>Netflix</a>, because they describe – in a very detailed way – <strong>the company culture and what they expect from future hires</strong>. I also read a lot about <a target='_blank' href='(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsbyE1Gk7x4)'>Yum Brand&#39;s recognition culture</a> where they encourage leaders to <strong>implement their own signature awards</strong> to recognize employee success. Moreover, they have special onboarding events celebrating new talents on a red carpet, and so much more. I think this is a great way to build and foster an employer brand from the inside. </p><p>Even though I do not agree with all of Yum Brand&#39;s views or actions, I think, in general, it&#39;s a good idea to just be open-minded and curious to pick great initiatives from various companies and mix &amp; match them with your own idea and organization&#39;s culture. </p><h3 id='meet-our-experts'>Meet Our Experts:</h3><p><strong><a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianjarzak/'>Marian Jarzak</a></strong>: is an Employer Branding Enthusiast, living in Berlin.

The talent should quarantine at home until they receive their results.

What is important to keep in mind when a talent needs to extend or change their work permit?</h2><p>When the Foreign Agencies closed to the public back in March, they also canceled most of the appointments. However, <strong>they’re still in operation and issuing confirmations on visa status’</strong> and extensions for probationary certificates. In Berlin, they have made online registration possible for those with canceled appointments or expired Visas — check if this is available in your city by typing <em>“Ausländerbehörde + your city”</em> and you should find what you’re looking for.</p><p>We are seeing many immigration offices slowly opening and they’re starting to invite applicants for appointments, starting with the most urgent cases (for example, those with an expired visa).</p><h3 id='here-is-what-you-need-to-know'>Here is what you need to know:</h3><ul><li>Citizens whose national visa (D visa) is about to expire should <strong>submit an application for an extension</strong> to the relevant immigration office. Do this by email and before the visa expires. Until the decision of the immigration office has been made, a probationary certificate called a <em>fiktionsbescheinigung</em> will be given. <strong>This means the talent can legally stay in Germany until their appointment</strong>. You should, however, always check how the relevant immigration office is handling this situation.</li></ul><p>It’s important to make sure that personal details (surname, maiden name, first name, spelling of the names, date of birth, place and district of birth, gender, nationality, passport number), type of title and any file number must be specified. </p><ul><li><p>Currently, most of the Foreign Agencies are accepting applications online. In Berlin, for example, <strong>it’s possible to send the applications for employer change</strong>, as well Blue Card applications online.</p></li><li><p>Plan for extra time. Due to the skilled workers immigration act, <strong>it is becoming increasingly difficult to stick a label for the work permit into the passport</strong>. Only when collecting the final work permit (usually 4-5 weeks after the appointment at the immigration office) is it possible to take over employment. In some cases there might be exceptions or preliminary certifications, but this needs to be checked with the responsible immigration authority. </p></li></ul><p><strong>To give you an example:</strong></p><p><em>A talent who holds a job seeker’s visa and fulfills all the criteria for the <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/ultimate-guide-EU-blue-card/'>Blue Card</a> can apply for it when having a valid job contract. The application can currently be done online. It’s important to check where the talent is <u>currently</u> registered and submit the application at the responsible Foreign Agency. The employee can only start working when they have the electronic residence card.</em></p><h2 id='in-a-nutshell'>In a nutshell:</h2><p>It’s not so easy to move people from one country to another anymore, so <strong>plan for a realistic timeframe</strong> as many structures and processes just don’t work at this time.</p><p>However, this doesn’t mean that we can’t support our talents. Now is the time where it’s important to listen, check-in on their current situation and feelings, provide as much information and context as possible, and try to find the best solutions for unexpected problems. Through <strong>showing your talents that you’re there to support them through difficult situations</strong>, you are contributing to their overall happiness and likelihood of engagement. </p><p>If you have any further questions, or you are needing support in relocating your Honeypot talents, we have a dedicated Talent Relocation Team who would be happy to help.

According to the recent <a target='_blank' href='https://get.workable.com/the-new-world-of-work'>New World of Work Report</a>, <strong>63% of companies went fully remote by the time COVID-19 hit its peak, and 82% say it will be important for candidates going forward.</strong> Not only that, but the option to work remotely is a <a target='_blank' href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8643844/'>number one priority</a> for most job-seeking developers.</p><p>If your company hasn’t thought about how it’s going to tackle remote work in the future, now is the time; especially in such highly competitive markets. As <a target='_blank' href='https://bebanjo.com/'>BeBanjo</a> CTO, Miguel Arroyo, says, <strong>“Remote allows you to access great talent since there are no regional boundaries.”</strong></p><p>However, one of the main challenges for companies building remote teams is exactly that: having employees all over the world. With it, you must consider that <strong>each country has its own legislation to abide by.</strong> The process can seem overwhelming, but to remain competitive, it’s a worthy investment. And as Doist says in their <a target='_blank' href='https://twist.com/remote-work-guides/remote-company-setup'>Remote Guide to Logistics</a>, you should “look at this process as innovating—you have a hand in architecting the economy of the future.”</p><p>The following is a legal guide for the hiring of remote developers, where we’ll look at the type of employment contract used and the legal arrangements a company could decide to undertake.</p><h2 id='first-hire-for-logistics'>First, hire for logistics</h2><p>If you work in a startup and want to hire a team of remote developers, one easy way is to <strong>contract offshore talent through a <a target='_blank' href='https://youteam.io/'>development agency</a></strong>. They would handle all financial, administrative and legal issues, and you’d just need to take over the onboarding process.</p><p>If you want to hire individual candidates, we’d suggest you hire an accountant or external lawyer because each country has a different tax treaty. </p><h2 id='best-contract-types-to-hire-your-developers'>Best contract types to hire your developers</h2><p>Remote job contracts can be whatever you want them to be: full-time or part-time, freelance or permanent, and they can have set or flexible schedules. </p><h3 id='full-time-developers'>Full-time developers</h3><p>Employees under a full-time remote contract are usually working 40 hours a week, are paid a salary and are entitled to receive benefits such as Social Security, Health and Life Insurance, and leave.</p><p>Both in the US and across Europe, <strong>individuals classified with an “employee” status are protected by law under well-defined rules</strong>. It’s important that your HR or people operations team are aware of the legal requirements for every case, as country legislation differs. </p><p>This will be your best bet when there is ongoing software development work that needs to be done while supervised. If you see this field as a long-term business goal, <strong>we recommend you hire full-time developers that understand</strong> and are loyal to your company.</p><p>If you’re wondering how to draft a remote working contract, Hubstaff details the process in their <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.hubstaff.com/hire-remote-workers-guide/'>free guide</a>. </p><h3 id='independent-contractors'>Independent contractors</h3><p>Unlike full-time contracts, <strong>many companies tend to hire independent contractors, who are different to freelancers</strong>. They are temporary employees who take on larger projects for longer-term customers and are paid hourly, daily, or per-project. In addition, <strong>they accept clients through a third-party agency</strong>. Freelancers, on the other hand, are hired for projects that don’t need ongoing maintenance.</p><p>You might consider hiring an independent contractor when:</p><ul><li><p>You have the option to hire developers for specific projects, periods, or even small tasks and milestones within the projects. They are experts in the specific fields your current projects demand.</p></li><li><p>Your business needs some extra hands to take on those projects, which would normally be too much for regular staff to handle on top of their own responsibilities. This might be the case for small businesses that might need a bit of a boost.</p></li></ul><h2 id='hiring-your-remote-developers'>Hiring your remote developers</h2><p>If you’re thinking about hiring or planning to outsource your tech team, and it’s not really feasible to set up a new office, you have various alternatives. Below are a couple of the steps you could take:</p><h3 id='1-decide-the-desired-target-location-for-hiring-remote-developers'>1. Decide the desired target location for hiring remote developers</h3><p>There are a few things to keep in mind as you make this decision, the most important being: Will the outsourced developer or team be working alongside the in-house team? If so, the time zone is a critical factor. </p><ul><li>For EU companies, Eastern European developers can easily reschedule their work to meet their demands.</li><li>For the USA, Latin American countries are their best option.</li><li>For Australia, South-East Asia would be ideal. </li></ul><h3 id='2-consider-which-factors-are-most-important-to-you'>2. Consider which factors are most important to you</h3><p>When looking to outsource development, there are a range of things to consider and each factor will be weighted differently for each company:</p><ul><li>the pay rate</li><li>level of expertise</li><li>convenient work schedule</li><li>preferred language proficiency</li></ul><h3 id='3-decide-on-your-hiring-avenue'>3. Decide on your hiring avenue</h3><p>Most companies establish a local entity in the worker’s home country, hire through a business partner or, most commonly, hire through independent contractors. Here’s what each option would look like.</p><h3 id='local-entity'>Local entity</h3><p>This is by far the safest option to avoid compliance issues, and it’s ideal for companies that are planning to hire in pre-designated countries.</p><p>If you want to hire many long-term developers or have other business interests in the country, <strong>setting up a business entity in the employee’s home country might be worth it</strong>. Then, employees will be hired through those entities. But if your business is in its early stages, the complexity and cost of establishing many entities may be too high. </p><p>Lucía Etxabe, HR &amp; Office Manager at BeBanjo, explains that they started from a small office to a scaled-up remote international business model. &quot;We are headquartered in Madrid but we have offices and entities in other countries, supporting local employees.&quot; Since a big part of their customer base are Hollywood studios, they have staff in Los Angeles and are planning to grow the team through their US entity.</p><p>Entity selection and employee structures go hand-in-hand. In order to select the right entity to support your operations, you’ll need the help of lawyers and tax experts from the very beginning. But before calling them, Doist suggests you set up a vision of what you want to build: </p><ul><li>Where will your employees be located?</li><li>Where are your customers?</li><li>What types of industries and markets do you serve? </li><li>Where are your strategic partners located?</li><li>What access to capital, investment, and/or financial resources will you need?</li><li>In what country(s) are your founders and the bulk of your team citizens?</li></ul><p>Although you will need to allocate part of your budget into this model, <strong>the advantages outweigh the cost.</strong> You’ll have full control over the entire employment process without needing to outsource to a third party, you’ll be able to hire from all over the world, and you’ll definitely avoid any risks of misclassification (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/employee-misclassification-resources.aspx'>the practice of labeling employees as independent contractors</a>).</p><h3 id='hiring-through-a-business-partner'>Hiring through a business partner</h3><p>If you have existing suppliers, vendors or business contacts located in the same country as your full-time employee, you might want to consider this option. </p><p>An example is when a company (parent) acquires a subsidiary (daughter), and the subsidiary hires a small team or individual in one of the regions where the parent company operates. In this case, the parent company puts the worker on their payroll and manages tax withholding and Social Security contributions, while at the same time the daughter company is under control of the employee. </p><p>If you hold a level of trust with your business partner, it’s an easy solution. </p><h3 id='hiring-independent-contractors'>Hiring independent contractors</h3><p>Contractors are responsible for their own taxes and benefits, so the company avoids legal difficulties and only needs to pay the developer under the agreed terms and schedule. </p><p>Most contractors have their preferred method of receiving their wages. While bank transfers are more costly, there are a few tools to make your life easier: </p><ul><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.paypal.com/es/home'>Paypal</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://transferwise.com/es'>Transferwise</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.payoneer.com/es/'>Payoneer</a></li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.bitwage.com/'>Bitwage</a></li></ul><h3 id='dont-underestimate-misclassification'>Don’t underestimate misclassification</h3><p>When paying a full-time employee or an independent contractor for the same or similar work, <strong>don’t forget there are legal differences between the two in regards to tax retention</strong>. A company will withhold income tax and Social Security to employees from their wages, but <strong>independent contractors will have to pay their own taxes</strong>. For more information, it’s best to get in touch with a legal counselor to avoid problems with misclassification.</p><p>Even so, when it comes to employee rights, there’s a thin line between misclassifying full-time employees and contractors. In fact, if the contractors have little control over their work and consider that they should be working under the same contract conditions and benefits as a full-time employee, they could sue the company for underpayment of wages, absence of benefits and increased exposure to a variety of risks. In this case, the employer might be obligated to pay a back bill for the benefits that it failed to provide. </p><p>Matthew Smith, Recruitment Manager at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.amazeelabs.com/en'>Amazee Labs</a>, says that many of their developers are employed as “full-time freelancers” rather than contractors, and they enjoy the same benefits as full-time employees, with the same equal standards such as notice period, time-off, onboarding, and so on. “This differs quite a bit from an independent contractor role –” he says, “as freelancers, they’re much more culturally integrated within the company.” </p><p>While this is the case for one company, it may not be for another, so it’s worth getting someone on board who can help.</p><h3 id='hybrid-models'>Hybrid models</h3><p>Some of the most common legal arrangements when hiring remote developers are covered above, but bigger corporations or companies in their expansion phase might want to consider more options. </p><p>GitLab is one of the first consolidated remote organizations operating on a global scale. They put horizontal integration in the spotlight, and made sure to have a highly structured legal team.</p><p>Summarized, they ensure legal compliance with: </p><ul><li><strong>GitLab entity</strong>: Developers can be employed directly through their own setup entities.</li><li><strong>PEOs</strong>: Where they don’t have an entity, they have companies in select countries that oversee all HR-related functions. They serve as an <a target='_blank' href='https://shieldgeo.com/what-is-an-employer-of-record/'>employer of record</a> to facilitate payments.</li><li><a target='_blank' href='https://www.optnation.com/blog/w2-vs-c2c/'><strong>C2C (Contractor)</strong></a>: A corporation or LLC invoices GitLab’s entity for GitLab related work.</li><li><strong>IND (Contractor)</strong>: In countries where they are not present they have hired people as independent contractors.</li></ul><p>If you are curious to know more, they shared a <a target='_blank' href='https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/#employer-of-record-providers'>public table</a> to guide companies in what is applicable in which location. </p><h2 id='key-takeaways'>Key takeaways</h2><p>We know the process for hiring remote developers is complex, but if you’re looking for opportunities to grow your developer team and remain competitive in this time, <strong>going remote is a powerful way to do so</strong>.</p><p>Before turning to external aid from specialised legal services, explore your options, follow the steps in this guide, and keep in mind that the legal requirements will differ depending on the type of contract. And remember to see this process for what it is: an investment in the future success of your company.</p>",

However, the time, energy and money it takes to find them is like banging your head against a wall.</p><p align='center'><img alt='OMRT company information' src='/assets/images/OMRT-in-image2.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>At OMRT, CTO and Co-Founder, Andreja Andrejevic, and his team build smart software solutions for real estate project developers and architects. As the company grows, so does the sophistication of their product and their need for specialised developers. </p><p>We spoke to Andreja about how Honeypot helps him find the right developers for his team quickly and efficiently, so he can spend his time where it matters most: innovating.  </p><p align='center'><img alt='OMRT company hiring stats' src='/assets/images/OMRT-in-image1.jpg' style='width:100% !important;'></p><br><p>In general, finding job-seeking developers isn’t difficult. Finding talented developers who are highly specialised, or with less common expertise is a whole other mission. <strong>With Honeypot, Andreja is able to save time and money spent sourcing on Linkedin and match with only the most relevant candidates</strong> through selecting his preferences on the platform.</p><p>“Our product consists of multiple engineering disciplines, and finding really good developers who have experience with Embedded Engineering, low level coding, and deep Machine Learning is difficult - especially on websites like LinkedIn,” says Andreja. But <strong>he finds plenty of developers matching his criteria on the Honeypot platform, often within a couple of days.</strong> “Usually, we’re lucky finding even one candidate that fits the criteria on other channels.”</p><p>Sourcing talent yourself can take up to (and sometimes exceed) two months, and can cost thousands of euros. If, like Andreja, you’re looking to hire highly specialised developers, you need other options. For him, this means attracting talent through his work with the Delft University of Technology, although many candidates are junior. <strong>“We rely on Honeypot to find developers with some more work experience,”</strong> Andreja explains.</p><p>With Honeypot, Andreja is presented with new ‘batches’ of talents every week, many of which are matched to his specific preferences. He also <strong>works closely with a dedicated Client Success Manager who sends him pre-screened potential candidate profiles</strong> that match what he’s looking for.  </p><p align='center'><img alt='OMRT team photo' src='/assets/images/OMRT-team-photo.jpeg' style='width:50% !important;'></p><br><p>Andreja also added ‘walking through Honeypot’ to his weekly To Do list to see which talents are available in a given week. <strong>“I spend about two hours per week on the platform and it’s way better than receiving 600 emails with random resumes,”</strong> he says, and when he finds a candidate he likes, he sends them a pre-created template, inviting them to an interview. If the candidate finds the job interesting, they schedule a call right away. </p><p>With time saved on sourcing, Andreja saves time on hiring overall. “Since Honeypot’s Talent Success Managers have already screened a talent for the qualities and capabilities they say they have,” he says, “I can see very clearly after the first interview if somebody fits on a technical level.” <strong>The entire hiring process only takes two to three weeks.</strong> </p><p>So far, hiring through Honeypot has been a success for Andreja, with three of their 20-person team coming from the platform. “They’ve been with us for almost six months, and we’re very happy with them - they’re great guys! <strong>In the second quarter of next year, we plan to scale again and I’ll definitely hire through Honeypot.”</strong></p><p>For Andreja, the greatest benefit of hiring through Honeypot has been the amount of time he’s saved by no longer passively sorting through irrelevant applications. He likes that <strong>the platform is easy to use, it’s fully tailored to tech positions and most importantly, the developers are really good.</strong> “The range of talent is broad so there must be a great developer for every company!”</p>",

That’s why, in the last two quarters, we tested several things to understand what could help our clients have more success on our platform.</p><p>We started by investigating the hiring process itself and the pain points of our clients. We suspected that clients would be more successful if they were not constrained by the traditional commission-based hiring model.</p><p><strong>We started testing out a subscription model in 2020 and found that our clients hire 3 times more talent on average than in the old commission-based model.</strong></p><h2 id='why-did-the-subscription-model-lead-to-so-many-more-hires'>Why did the subscription model lead to so many more hires?</h2><p>Commission-based hiring is built around short-term wins rather than long-term trust. It’s designed to solve one problem at a time. The focus of a commission based model is not a long-term relationship but rather ‘the next hire’. We know tech recruiting can be notoriously difficult and complicated, and the only way to master it is through reliable partners and processes.</p><p>In the past several months, we have found that businesses on the subscription model hired three times the amount of talent and they did it more quickly.

Such high costs can slow down, or even stop the hiring process for many companies. However, because this was based on a subscription model, the hiring companies were free to keep hiring. They had the flexibility to choose a plan that worked for them and that made financial sense. Plus, the subscription model made it easier for companies to plan costs and allot resources.</p><p>&quot;Honeypot will always focus on the developers and nothing will change for our developer community. But now is a good time to put an additional focus on pricing for companies that need to hire tech talent on a large scale. So we are taking a new path away from a commission-based pricing and towards a subscription model. Companies will pay a monthly membership fee and then be able to hire developers free of additional charges via Honeypot. <strong>This will enable us to build long-term partnerships with our customers and provide personal and individual help in building great tech teams.”</strong>Philipp Goos, CEO at Honeypot</p><h2 id='the-timeline-and-how-to-make-the-switch'>The timeline and how to make the switch</h2><p>On November 1st 2020, we officially announced that we would be changing from a commission-based model to a membership-based model with dedicated assistance for all clients.</p><p><strong>Starting April first, the Honeypot platform will only be available to subscription customers, for German and Austrian customers.</strong> We would like to ask any customers based in these countries to be sure they have signed a new subscription-based contract in order to avoid any disruptions.

From Europe to Asia to the US, developers can apply their expertise and enjoy work and life across the globe, making it easier than ever to try new things, experience new cultures and leave your hometown for a taste of something fresh.</p><p>But while many companies from different countries seek similar skills and points on your CV, the visa requirements to work and live somewhere frequently differ. In this guide, we’ll break down how to get the work visa you’ll need to work in Austria.</p><p>Do you want to get a peek into the Austrian developer scene? Then watch our <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWoLf5QyOA'>DevCities Vienna episode</a>.</p><h4 id='in-short-developers-who-want-to-work-in-austria-usually-apply-for-the-red-white-red-card-but-you-can-also-aim-for-an-eu-blue-card-or-even-a-short-term-visa-for-shorter-stays'><strong>In short: Developers who want to work in Austria usually apply for the Red-White-Red Card, but you can also aim for an EU Blue Card or even a short-term visa for shorter stays</strong>.</h4><p>If you can’t get enough of Austria, there’s even a path to permanent residency once you’ve spent five years living and working legally in the country. Read on to find out the ins and outs of each work visa, the documents you’ll need for your visa application and the application process itself.</p><h3 id='do-i-need-an-austrian-work-visa'>Do I need an Austrian work visa?</h3><p>If you are an EEA or Swiss citizen, you can work and live in Austria without a visa. But if you’re a non-EU citizen - commonly called a ‘third-country national’ - and you want to work in Austria or simply visit for more than 180 days, you’ll be required to obtain a work visa.</p><p>Austria has many different kinds of work visas - including ones specific to artists, PhD researchers and au pairs! - but in this article we’ll discuss the most common ones useful for developers (or companies who want to hire foreign developers). Let’s go through them one by one.</p><h2 id='the-eu-blue-card'>The EU Blue Card</h2><p>The Blue Card is a working visa that is valid in all European Union member states except Denmark and Ireland - that means Austria accepts it! It allows skilled third-country nationals to live and work in the EU and is typically  issued for the duration of your employment contract plus three months, with a cap at four years. Though it is valid for most EU members, it’s important to note that it doesn’t necessarily mean you can move freely across the EU - usually, your Blue Card will only be valid in the country where you applied for it. So if you want to work in Austria, you’ll need to apply for a Blue Card at an Austrian Embassy, Austrian Consulate or an accredited Visa Application Centre for Austria.</p><p><strong>The advantage of a Blue Card in Austria is that you don’t have to meet the points system other work visas require. However, your salary needs to be higher as a result.</strong> The Blue Card is a popular choice throughout the EU.</p><p>You can find out more about the Blue Card in our<a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/ultimate-guide-EU-blue-card/'> comprehensive guide</a>! Head there for more information about eligibility, requirements and the documentation you’ll need to apply for a Blue Card.</p><h2 id='short-term-working-visas'>Short Term Working Visas</h2><p><strong>If you want to spend at least two years in Austria</strong>, or you’re not sure how long you want to be in Austria, the best option is applying for a Red-White-Red Card (we’ll go into more detail about below).</p><p><strong>But if you want to spend less time in Austria</strong>, whether it’s for a short contract, temporary position or even an internship, there are two visas for short-term employment. The two visas are:</p><ul><li>the <strong>C Visa</strong> (or Visum V-Erwerb in German), which allows a stay of up to 90 days</li><li>the <strong>D Visa</strong> (Visum D-Erwerb in German), which allows a stay between 91 and 180 days.</li></ul><p>To apply for either a C Visa or a D Visa, you’ll need the following documents for your application:</p><ul><li><p>Visa C or Visa D application form</p></li><li><p>Valid travel document</p></li><li><p>Passport-sized photo (colour photograph, size 3.5 x 4.5 cm)</p></li><li><p>Copy of your contract or preliminary contract with an Austrian employer</p></li><li><p>Proof of accommodation</p></li><li><p>Sufficient travel health insurance</p></li><li><p>Proof of ties to your home country, such as university enrollment or family at home</p></li></ul><p>Note that both of these visas require that you are <em>already</em> the recipient of a job offer. <strong>You cannot claim a C Visa or D Visa, enter the country and then find a job: you must have the job offer first</strong>.</p><h2 id='the-red-white-red-card'>The Red-White-Red Card</h2><p>The Red-White-Red Card is one of the most popular and practical visas in Austria. It provides both work authorisation and residency, and while its length depends on your particular situation it is usually valid for 24 months with the possibility of renewal.</p><p>Red-White-Red Cards are issued on a points system, which means that you have to meet a certain number of points (for example 70) to qualify for the visa. You gain points based on your professional history and suitability, but also on other factors, including age, previous study or work experience in Austria, German language ability, English language ability and more.</p><p>There are different kinds of Red-White-Red Cards depending upon your history, qualifications and professional situation. Some Red-White-Red Cards are for third-country nationals who have completed graduate studies in Austria. There’s even a Red-White-Red Card for applicable startup founders!</p><p>But if you’re a developer looking to work at an Austrian company – or an Austrian company looking to hire foreign developers – it’s likely that you’ll be looking at one of the following cards.</p><ul><li><p>Red-White-Red Card for Skilled Workers in Shortage Occupations</span> (“Fachkräfte in Mangelberufen”). This card is for third-country nationals who already have a job offer and training or education in a shortage occupation. Shortage occupations can be found in a<a target='_blank' href='https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/austria-wide-shortage-occupations/'> list which is updated annually</a> and there are occupations which might be relevant for developers depending upon your professional background and interests, including data processing engineers and more. <strong>This is the most common type of Red-White-Red Card issued to developers</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Red-White-Red Card for Very Highly Qualified Workers</span> (&quot;Besonders Hochqualifizierte”). This is for third-country nationals who have special qualifications, for example in graduate education or senior management positions. This would also be a good fit for anyone who has research and innovation history to their name.</p></li><li><p>Red-White-Red Card for Other Key Workers</span> (“Sonstige Schlüsselkräfte”). This card is for employees who are not encompassed in the other two categories but have still received an offer of employment as a skilled worker. The most important thing to note here is that your employment offer has to meet a minimum salary requirement, which is dependent upon your age. In 2022 those requirements are: for those under 30 years of age €2,835 gross monthly pay plus special payments (holiday and Christmas pay); for those over 30 years of age €3,402 gross monthly pay plus special payments (holiday and Christmas pay).</p></li></ul><p>It’s important to note that the Red-White-Red card is always tied to a <strong>specific employer</strong>. That means you can’t change or lose your job during the validity period of your Red-White-Red card, unless you want to start the application from scratch. If you want to change your employer, you’ll have to apply for a new Red-White-Red Card and the Public Employment Service (AMS) will examine whether you meet the criteria in your new employment. If you’re thinking about changing employers, make sure you have calculated the time it will take for your new application and whether you are able to stay legally in Austria during that time. <strong>The standard application time for a Red-White-Red Card is eight to twelve weeks, starting the moment that you hand in your application.</strong> Remember that gathering the documents required for the application can itself be a time-consuming process, so you’ll need to allow adequate time to accomplish this. Sometimes the Austrian authorities will also request more supporting documents, which can further extend the application time.</p><p>Once you have held the Red-White-Red Card for two years, you’ll be eligible to apply for a <strong>Red-White-Red Card plus,</strong> as long as you were employed within the eligibility requirements for a minimum of 21 months during the previous 24 months. The Red-White-Red Card plus is valid for from one to three years, depending upon how long you have already been lawfully settled in Austria. With the Red-White-Red Card plus, you are permitted to change your employer at any time without applying for a new permit. The Red-White-Red Card plus is also generally considered the standard path to permanent residency in Austria.</p><p>The Red-White-Red Card plus is also eligible for family members of Red-White-Red Card holders or EU Blue Card holders. So, for example, if you want to move to Austria with your husband, and you have a Red-White-Red Card, your husband can apply for the Red-White-Red Card plus once your application has been approved.</p><h3 id='how-do-i-apply-for-a-red-white-red-card'>How do I apply for a Red-White-Red Card?</h3><p>The checklist for applying for a Red-White-Red Card depends a little based on which particular card you’re applying for, so make sure you check out all the requirements for your particular case on the<a target='_blank' href='https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/'> Austrian government’s migration website</a>.</p><p>Below is <strong>an example checklist for The Red-White-Red Card for Other Key Workers</strong>.</p><p>To apply for this visa, you’ll need:</p><ul><li><p>A job offer for a skilled position from a company offering the required minimum wage (see above). Note that the position has to be confirmed as one where the Public Employment Service (AMS) were unable to find equally qualified people registered as employed (a labour market check)</p></li><li><p>A minimum score of at least 55 points by the Red-White-Red Card<a target='_blank' href='https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/other-key-workers/'> criteria for other key workers</a>     </p></li><li><p>A filled out and signed <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bmi.gv.at/302/Formulare/20180901/11_Rot-Weiss-Rot-Karte-Formular.pdf'>application form</a>     </p></li><li><p>A valid travel document</p></li><li><p>Passport-sized photograph in colour, not older than six months </p></li><li><p>Proof of accommodation in Austria, for example a rental or subtenancy contract or accommodation agreement (“Wohnrechtsvereinbarung”)</p></li><li><p>Proof of completed professional education and training (a certificate or diploma: most important is proof that you have studied for at least three years)</p></li></ul><p>If you’re arguing that you have special knowledge and skills, you need to provide proof (i.e. recommendation, certificate confirming the completion of specific education or training, employment verification):</p><ul><li><p>A school leaving certificate, such as a high school diploma</p></li><li><p>Proof of completed degree program with a minimum duration of three years at a tertiary education institution</p></li><li><p>Proof of professional experience (recommendations, employment verification etc)</p></li><li><p>Proof of German or English language skills (internationally-recognised language diploma or course certificate; find a list of approved course certificates <a target='_blank' href='https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/skilled-workers-in-shortage-occupations/'>here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Employer statement according to the Act Governing Employment of Foreign Nationals (AuslBG)</p></li></ul><p>First-time applicants will sometimes additionally need to provide a copy of their passport, birth certificate or equivalent document and a police clearance certificate from your country of residence not older than three months at the time of your application.</p><p><strong>Please note that all application material needs to be submitted in German or English</strong>. That means foreign documents (like a birth certificate or police clearance certificate) need to be translated and verified. Since the coronavirus pandemic, it has been more common for Austrian authorities to accept copies of official documents during the application process, and you only need to bring the original documents with you to finalise the process once everything is approved. However, some smaller cities or particular authorities still require original documents, so it’s a good idea to prepare for both scenarios.</p><p>The <strong>cost</strong> of the application comes to €160: €120 when you submit the application, €20 when the permit is granted and €20 for the collection of police identification data.</p><h4 id='which-documents-take-the-most-time-to-procure'>Which documents take the most time to procure?</h4><p>As we mentioned above, the process of collecting documents can be just as time-consuming (if not even more so!) than the time it takes the Austrian authorities to process your application. It’s a good idea to make sure that you allocate enough time to get these documents together ahead of time.</p><p>For example, in many countries and companies, it is no longer common practice to provide reference letters to employees. In Austria, this is not only common practice, it’s also a visa requirement in order to prove your work experience. For this requirement, you’ll need to plan to both request the document and wait for previous employers to create them.</p><p>Another time-consuming process is legalising your documents. In most cases, personal documents need to be legalised or you will require an Apostille. If you don’t live in a city close to an embassy or if your local Apostille-granting office is booked up, you’ll need to factor in the time it takes to get an appointment and have these documents officially authorised.</p><h4 id='what-if-i-dont-have-a-job-offer-yet'>What if I don’t have a job offer yet?</h4><p>If you’re determined to live in Austria but haven’t found your dream job yet, you can try to apply for a <strong>jobseeker’s visa</strong>. However, it’s crucial to note that, like the Red-White-Red Card, the jobseeker’s visa works under a points system. You need to score a minimum 70 points out of a maximum 100. (You can find the full list of criteria <a target='_blank' href='https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/very-highly-qualified-workers/'>here</a>.)</p><p>Generally, only highly qualified candidates are able to score 70 points on this scale. Sometimes even candidates with very good profiles will only just score 60! For this type of visa, it’s necessary to have a high level of education such as a PhD, research activities or work experience in a senior management position and more.</p><p>If you enter Austria with the jobseeker’s visa, you have <strong>six months</strong> to stay in the country and look for a job legally. But it’s not a work permit: once you are offered a role, you have to apply for the Red-White-Red Card or another applicable work visa.</p><h3 id='what-if-i-want-permanent-residency'>What if I want permanent residency?</h3><p>Visa red tape is a headache, especially when you have to do it on an annual basis! Austria does offer a path towards permanent residency, but it does take time. First of all, you’ll most likely apply for a Red-White-Red Card plus, which offers more freedom in terms of changing employers. And then you can continue to pursue permanent residency.</p><p>The requirements for permanent residency in Austria include:</p><ul><li><p>Living uninterrupted and legally in Austria for the past five years</p></li><li><p>Proof of having supported yourself financially</p></li><li><p>Proof of having maintained health insurance </p></li><li><p>Proof of having maintained adequate, registered accommodation</p></li><li><p>Completion of Module 2 of the Integration Agreement, including reaching a B1 level of German</p></li></ul><p>Once you have met these requirements, you may apply for the “Long-term resident - EU” visa (in German, _Aufenthaltstitel “Daueraufenthalt EU_”), which gives you permanent right of residence.</p><h3 id='happy-applying'>Happy applying!</h3><p>Visas can be complicated.

      "contents": "<p>There are many reasons you might be drawn to live in Switzerland: amazing scenery, outdoor adventures from skiing to hiking, great fondue! And for developers, a vibrant working culture with huge demand for more software engineers and a booming startup scene. In 2019 Switzerland attracted $445 million in investments, and unlike more US-centric working cultures, overtime is much less expected, even in startups. Which means that you can enjoy a great salary, great job opportunities and great quality of life, with plenty of time on the weekends to enjoy your newfound love of mountains.</p><p>But working in Switzerland as a non-Swiss national requires a valid work permit and, in some cases, a work visa. In this guide, we’ll break down some of the most common visas, their eligibility requirements and what you’ll need to apply.</p><h3 id='do-i-need-a-visa-to-work-in-switzerland'>Do I need a visa to work in Switzerland?</h3><p>Despite being almost completely surrounded by EU states (shout out to Liechtenstein, the one exception), Switzerland itself is not a member of the European Union. However, as a member of the Schengen Area, Switzerland allows freedom of movement and it is also a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). This means that even if you are an EU citizen, you will still need official authorisation to live and work in Switzerland. However, the process is different for EU citizens and third country nationals (that’s everyone else, from Australians to Zimbabweans).</p><p>For both EU citizens and third country nationals, Switzerland restricts the quota of work permits available. That means that even if you fit every other criteria, you could be denied a work permit simply because too many have already been issued that year: an issue that occurs regularly for people looking to work in Switzerland! It’s a very real possibility, with the result that you’ll need to plan carefully and hope for the result. In 2022, the quotas are:</p><ul><li><p>4000 “L” short-term permits for non-EU/EFTA nationals</p></li><li><p>4500 “B” long-term permits for non-EU/EFTA nationals</p></li><li><p>3000 “L” short-term permits for service providers/seconded workers based in the EU/EFTA</p></li><li><p>500 “B” long-term permits for service providers/seconded workers based in the EU/EFTA</p></li><li><p>1400 “L” short-term permits for British nationals</p></li><li><p>2100 “B” long-term permits for British nationals</p></li></ul><h3 id='working-in-switzerland-as-an-eu-citizen'>Working in Switzerland as an EU citizen</h3><p><strong>If you’re an EU national,</strong> you are free to move to Switzerland to work and live and you will not be asked for a visa upon entry into the country. <strong>However, you will still need a residence permit for stays longer than three months.</strong> You must apply for this residence permit at one of the cantonal migration offices within 14 days of arriving in Switzerland. If you haven’t found a job in Switzerland after three months, the canton can grant you a short-term residence permit for another three months which can be extended for up to one year. If you are already working, this residence permit doubles as your work permit.</p><p>Even if you are a citizen of an EU state, you should always check if there are specific regulations about your country. While Switzerland has no exceptions currently, in the past it has imposed additional criteria, quotas and regulations for other EU countries, including Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania, which made it more difficult for citizens from those countries to work in Switzerland.</p><p>There are different residence permits available to EU citizens who want to live and work in Switzerland. The most relevant for developers are:</p><ul><li><p>Type L EU/EFTA short-term residence permit: valid up to 12 months. If your work contract is less than 12 months, the permit lasts as long as the contract.</p></li><li><p>Type B EU/EFTA residence permit: valid for five years (and extendable). Tor those with employment contracts of more than 12 months as well as self-employed workers. You must be able to demonstrate you can support yourself financially and have adequate insurance cover. </p></li><li><p>Type G EU/EFTA cross-border commuter permit: valid for five years with a 12-month+ employment contract. If your contract is less than a year, the permit lasts as long as the contract. This permit is for people who live outside Switzerland but have a Swiss employer and commute to work.You have to return to your home outside of Switzerland at least once a week. </p></li><li><p>Type C EU/EFTA settlement permit: is similar to permanent residency, although it has to be confirmed every five years. If you have been employed and living in Switzerland for five continuous years, you might be eligible for this settlement permit if you are a national from Belgium, Germany, Denmark, France, Liechtenstein, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Finland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden may be granted this settlement permit after living in Switzerland for five continuous years. If you are from another EU/EFTA state, you need to have lived in Switzerland for 10 continuous years before you apply for this permit.</p></li></ul><p>If you lose or leave your job, you can stay for another three to six months in Switzerland to look for another job, after applying for authorisation from the cantonal migration authorities. Only people with a settlement permit may apply for welfare benefits.</p><h3 id='working-in-switzerland-as-a-third-country-national'>Working in Switzerland as a third country national</h3><p>There are two main Swiss work visas for third country nationals. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>Permit L:</strong> a short-term residence permit that gives you permission to live and work in Switzerland for up to one year. It is tied to the terms of the employment contract. In exceptional cases, the L permit may be extended for a further year, but not any longer under the same employer.</li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Permit B:</strong> an initial or temporary residence permit valid for one year, which can be extended annually. These permits are issued on a quota basis and are tied to the same employer, so you cannot lose or leave your job without also having to leave Switzerland and apply for a new work visa with a new company.</p></li><li><p><strong>There is one other significant visa for third country nationals, which is Permit C</strong>. This permit is eligible for third country nationals who have lived in Switzerland for ten continuous years (or five, if you are a US or Canadian citizen) and it offers permanent residence. With a C permit you can change employers at will.</p></li></ul><p>If you are not from an EU state, the work visa situation is a little more complicated. The simplest way to think about it is this: <strong>if you are an EU citizen, you need a work permit. If you are a third country national, you need a work permit and a work visa.</strong> The work permit is what gives you permission to work in Switzerland; the work visa is what gives you permission to enter the country, and it is the document you show to border authorities upon arrival.</p><h3 id='heres-how-it-works'>Here’s how it works.</h3><p>Your prospective employer applies for your work permit on your behalf, before you enter Switzerland. This means, of course, that you need to have a job offer ready before you apply for the visa, as the work permit is part of your visa application. Your employer has to apply to the immigration authority at their local Swiss canton, which is then sent for approval to the SEM (State Secretariat for Migration).</p><p>The work visa, on the other hand, is something you’ll have to handle personally. You can apply for the work visa through the Swiss embassy or consulate in your home country. However, you must have the work permit approved before your visa is granted. The cantonal migration authority stays in contact with embassies and consulates, so if your work permit application is successful, they will give your local embassy/consulate visa clearance for you.</p><p> The basic requirements you need to meet in order to apply for the work visa are:</p><ul><li><p>A job offer in place in Switzerland</p></li><li><p>A role as a manager, specialist or highly qualified worker (this includes many developers!)</p></li><li><p>You are applying at a time when the annual work permit quotas (see above) are not full</p></li><li><p>There is nobody suitable and available in Switzerland or any EU/EFTA country for the job</p></li><li><p>Your job offer has the same salary and work conditions that would apply to a Swiss citizen</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes the authorities will also consider additional criteria, including language skills, ability to integrate into Swiss society, criminal record and your ability to support yourself and any family members who join you in Switzerland. It’s a good idea to have documentation ready which attests to these criteria as well.</p><p>In addition to a specific visa application form for the type of visa you’re applying for (see below), you will need the following documents:</p><ul><li>Photocopy of your passport or valid travel ID</li><li>Proof of your job offer, for example an offer letter, copy of the employment contract, etc</li><li>Your CV (translated officially and notarised into German, French, Italian or English if necessary)</li><li>Copies of educational and work qualifications (again, translated and notarised when necessary)</li></ul><p>The visa application process usually takes 8-10 weeks. It must be done outside of Switzerland - <strong>if you are in Switzerland when you receive a job offer, you must return to your home country to apply for the visa.</strong></p><h3 id='how-much-does-a-swiss-visa-or-work-permit-cost'>How much does a Swiss visa or work permit cost?</h3><p>The cost of a work permit can vary from canton to canton, but typically it is around €95. Sometimes your employer will cover the cost of the work permit for you.</p><p>The cost of a work visa is €80 for an adult, and €40 for an accompanying child to enter. You may have to pay extra if you want the visa fast-tracked.</p><h3 id='can-i-bring-my-family-with-me-to-switzerland'>Can I bring my family with me to Switzerland?</h3><p>EU/EFTA citizens with valid work permits can be joined by spouses/partners, children, grandchildren, parents and grandparents. You may have to prove that the family member you wish to bring with you is financially or in some other way reliant upon you.</p><p>If you are a third country national, you will need a C permit to bring a spouse/partner and children under 18 with you. In this case, your spouse will be permitted to work or become self-employed.</p><p>If you are a third country national with a B or L residence permit, you don’t have the automatic right to bring family members with you. However, you can apply to the cantonal authorities for special authorisation to bring a spouse or dependent children with you. If authorisation is granted, your spouse will have the right to work in Switzerland. This is easier for people holding the B residence permit than the L residence permit.</p><h3 id='how-do-i-get-started'>How do I get started?</h3><p>As is now clear, the most important part of applying for a Swiss work visa, especially as a third country national, is having a Swiss job offer! Once you have that Swiss job offer and your employer provides you with a work permit, you can get started on the visa process.</p><h4 id='having-trouble-connecting-with-swiss-companies-let-honeypot-help-out-we-help-companies-in-germany-austria-switzerland-and-the-netherlands-find-experienced-developers-sign-up-here-and-if-youre-accepted-on-our-platform-youll-start-receiving-interview-invites-your-swiss-adventure-awaits-sign-up-here-and-if-youre-accepted-on-our-platform-youll-start-receiving-interview-invites-we-can-even-help-you-with-that-tricky-visa-process'>Having trouble connecting with Swiss companies?

Her newly restricted pandemic life meant that had a lot of time at home to think about her situation, her lifestyle, her hopes and dreams, and she began to consider the idea of moving to a new country.</p><p>On her 31st birthday, Zahra was ready for a change.</p><p>It was September 2020, and Zahra, a software developer, had lived in Iran her whole life. Based in Tehran with her husband, Zahra was working from home and reconsidering what she wanted. Her newly restricted pandemic life meant that had a lot of time at home to think about her situation, her lifestyle, her hopes and dreams, and she began to consider the idea of moving to a new country.</p><p>“In recent years, the quality of life had decreased in Iran - economic, social and cultural rights were eroded and I wasn’t happy there anymore,&quot; said Zahra. &quot;I’d always thought about immigrating, where I could improve my job prospects and work in an international company, but was scared that I wasn’t ready. My self-confidence wasn’t there yet.”</p><p><em>But that birthday, she decided she was ready for that challenge.</em> She decided to take the plunge and start looking for job opportunities in Europe. She watched YouTube videos where other Iranian people explained how they had successfully applied for overseas jobs from Iran. In one video, the developer suggested using Honeypot, a job platform specifically for developers and tech professionals. Zahra created her account the next day.</p><p>“I got lots of support from Honeypot, and lots of companies started to send me interview invitations,” Zahra said. “Overall, my experience applying as a candidate from Iran was good.”</p><p>Some companies were happy to help Zahra with her upcoming immigration process (including the one that hired her!). “But I did also have the experience where, if a company had a European applicant who had the same skills as me, they would prefer to offer the job to them. It’s quite tough.”</p><p><em>Less than one week after she created her Honeypot profile in January 2021, she interviewed with Blackshark,</em> a company working on creating 3D models of the earth.</p><p>“All the interviewers were very friendly and supportive,” Zahra praised. “I was so excited by Blackshark’s friendly atmosphere, its flat hierarchy, the trust between colleagues and also the awesome work they were doing.”</p><p>Two weeks after the interview, Blackshark offered her a role as Python Engineer. Of course, for anyone who has ever immigrated to a new country, you know that’s only half the battle.</p><h3 id='job-offer-in-now-the-visa-process-begins'>Job offer in… now the visa process begins</h3><p>Applying for a visa involves a lot of admin. You have to gather documents that attest to lots of different aspects of your life: your education, your work history, your financial situation, your family and more. Often you have to make appointments to obtain or certify those documents. And alongside all of that, you might still be working full time! </p><p>Luckily, Zahra was introduced to Manuel, one of Honeypot’s country managers. He helps provide visa relocation support for companies hiring overseas talent on the platform. Manuel helped both Zahra and her new employer understand the required documents and provided templates to help them get started.</p><p>Less than a month after Zahra signed her contract, she was able to send off her visa application. </p><p>“Honeypot helped me so much through my visa process. They took care of everything,” she said.</p><p>...And did we mention that she sent her application in March 2021? Shortly after the application was in, COVID-19 hit. The lockdowns began, including in Austria, and Zahra was eager to escape the work from home lifestyle. Visa applications like Zahra’s can often take a couple of months and with the pandemic, there was no reason to believe the process would be quick.</p><p>Yet, in a little over four weeks, the Austrian visa authorities in Graz approved a <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.honeypot.io/austria-work-visa-developers/'>Red White Red Card</a> for Zahra. This unusually-named visa is all she needed to immigrate. Shortly thereafter, she was able to secure a Red White Red Card plus for her husband.</p><p>While we’ll never know what prompted the Austria authorities to move so quickly, Manuel suggests that Zahra’s speed and commitment to the process must have made an impact. He says it was, by far, the fastest Red White Red Card process he has witnessed to date.</p><p>In early May, as the pandemic was in full swing, Zahra and her husband finally arrived in Austria.</p><h3 id='life-in-austria'>Life in Austria</h3><p>Of course, moving to a new country isn’t all tasty new foods and cool sights. There are going to be some hurdles.</p><p>“I was concerned about the language barrier–worried I wouldn’t be able to integrate into society easily, and also that I wouldn’t find a community,” Zahra said. “But at the same time, I was so excited to see Europe. And I knew that I would have more freedom as a woman. In Iran, I had to wear a hijab, but here it’s not compulsory. Here in Austria, I can ride a bicycle, dance in the street, and wear whatever I like!”</p><p>Once she became settled in Graz and her new job, many of Zahra’s fears drifted away. The city, her teammates and new projects all keep her going.</p><p>“Every day I wake up with so much motivation! I know I’m starting my day with the most friendly and supportive people at Blackshark, and every day I have something new to solve that makes me feel alive.” </p><p>In the end, Zahra says that she feels free and happy in Austria. Though she misses her family and being able to hear and use her mother tongue, she’s finding life in Europe is exactly what she needed.</p><p>Before you go - watch our <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWoLf5QyOA'>DevCities Vienna episode</a> to get a peek into the daily lives of Austrian developers.</p>",

      "contents": "<p>The workplace as we know it has ceased to exist. Was that too dramatic? Perhaps. But we can&#39;t deny that the last few years created a drastic shift in working conditions. And that shift opened up a new avenue of employment possibilities - one of them being globally remote.</p><p>The concept of remote work has massively gained popularity. The normalization of flexible working, paired with talent scarcity, has created an ideal environment for its rise. While the benefits are plenty, we need to admit that remote setups entail their own set of hurdles. To clear the path, service providers - known as Employers of Record (EORs) - began helping companies with hiring employees across borders. EORs allow companies to tap into the remote talent pool, without having to deal with relocation, payroll, legal, and administrative logistics. No wonder they have piqued the interest of many.</p><p>But can it really be this simple? And our short answer is: every endeavor comes with its own set of challenges. We&#39;re all looking for quick wins, especially in times of high hiring need. We&#39;re here to support you in making the best possible decision. So, before you commit to a service provider, we advise you to read our <strong>Employer of Record Decision-Making Guide</strong>.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://hello.honeypot.io/b2b-employer-of-record-org/'>Get the free EOR guide</a></p><h2 id='what-is-an-employer-of-record-eor'><strong>What is an Employer of Record (EOR)?</strong></h2><p>Say you find a talent, a perfect match, but for some reason, you are unable to employ them. But don&#39;t break into tears just yet, you can still hire that talent through an EOR. How does that work you ask?</p><p>An Employer of Record is a service provider that allows you to engage global talent as if they were your &quot;own employee&quot;. The EOR remains responsible from employment law, social security, and tax perspective throughout your service relationship. In short, an EOR becomes the full legal employer of that talent while you benefit from the services that the talent provides.</p><p>Using an EOR solution does come with a price. Generally, their services are charged either as a percentage of the employee&#39;s yearly salary or at a fixed price per month per leased employee.</p><h3 id='the-difference-between-a-peo-and-eor'><strong>The difference between a PEO and EOR</strong></h3><p>When you are hiring globally remote, you will find two common models or concepts: the Employer of Record (EOR) and the Professional Employer Organization (PEO).</p><p>Even though the expressions might refer to two different models in some jurisdictions, they actually mean the same model in others. Therefore, it is important to focus rather on the offered services than on their label.</p><p>In general, both models support you in complying with the local employment laws (social security, and tax) when hiring globally remote. Contrary to an EOR, a PEO often just offers local HR support (payroll and legal advice) without becoming the legal employer of the talent. In such case, the responsibility for observing all employment related obligations remains with you. This is the biggest difference between both models.</p><h3 id='what-solution-does-the-employer-of-record-provide'><strong>What solution does the Employer of Record provide?</strong></h3><p>The main problem EORs are solving is allowing companies to hire and pay remote employees without the necessity to observe employers&#39; obligations.</p><p>You can expect an EOR to:</p><ul><li>Prepare the employment contract</li><li>Complete the employee onboarding</li><li>Register your talent with the local government</li><li>Manage employee benefits</li><li>Process the payroll for the employee</li><li>Take care of social security and taxes</li><li>Ensure adherence to regional labor laws</li></ul><h3 id='most-common-use-cases-for-an-eor'><strong>Most common use cases for an EOR</strong></h3><p>Entering a new market is a complex and lengthy process. An EOR can speed up your international expansion and act as a catalyst for widening your talent pool.</p><p>Having an Employer of Record could benefit your business when you&#39;d like to:</p><ul><li><strong>Expand to new markets without hassle:</strong> this makes it easier to validate your market before you enter &quot;full-force&quot; and open a branch.</li><li><strong>Keep an employee that is relocating:</strong> if you&#39;d like to retain a talented worker that is determined to move to a different country.</li><li><strong>Employ freelancers:</strong> when the one-off project was so well done, you&#39;d like to include the remote freelancer in your team.</li><li><strong>Make the switch to remote-first:</strong> if you are ready to forget about office life and enhance your employer branding.</li></ul><h2 id='permanent-establishment'><strong>Permanent establishment</strong></h2><p>What&#39;s a big challenge and worry when a company starts working with an international workforce? It&#39;s a concept called the creation of a <em>permanent establishment</em> (PE).</p><p>It means that a business can be subject to corporate tax in a country, even though neither a subsidiary nor a legal entity has been established there. For the creation of a PE, it is sufficient to have tax-relevant business activities in that country.</p><p>We&#39;re telling you this because the creation of a PE might result from business activities carried out by the &quot;leased&quot; employees on your behalf.</p><p>And how is this connected to our topic on the global workforce? First and foremost, the biggest factor when leasing a talent through an EOR is the residency of that talent. The country your remote hire is residing could understand that you&#39;ve created a PE - in their jurisdiction. As that might create a taxable presence in that country, you&#39;ll want to avoid creating one by accident.</p><p>The PE risk will mainly depend on the activities and scope of business carried out by the talent. You should be especially careful if the local &quot;leased&quot; talent carries out any sales activities. Before hiring a talent in another country, you should always consult a tax expert.</p><h2 id='how-to-stay-compliant-when-partnering-with-an-eor'><strong>How to stay compliant when partnering with an EOR</strong></h2><p>We firmly believe borders should not be an obstacle when hiring a great workforce. And the good news is we can visibly notice a massive change in attitude towards global hiring.</p><p>Nevertheless, globally remote is not as simple as we&#39;d like it to be. Navigating through the realm of labor law and choosing from different EOR vendors can be overwhelming - especially during hiring urgency.</p><p>We want to aid you in making an informed decision when it comes to these employment types. That is why we suggest you read <a target='_blank' href='https://hello.honeypot.io/b2b-employer-of-record-org/'>Honeypot&#39;s EOR guide</a> when considering hiring remotely through an EOR.</p><h2 id='what-to-expect-from-honeypots-employer-of-record-guide'><strong>What to expect from Honeypot&#39;s Employer of Record Guide</strong></h2><p>As already stated, the residence of your remote hire will play the most crucial role when making a hire in a foreign land. In our guide, you will find important information regarding EOR laws and requirements for 16 European countries.</p><p>Every country page follows the same framework. We have split the information into the following sections:</p><ol><li><strong>EOR regulations:</strong> make sure your EOR is complying with the local laws.</li><li><strong>Employment T&amp;Cs:</strong> understand T&amp;Cs you&#39;ll need to comply with.</li><li><strong>Premature termination:</strong> familiarize yourself with local termination and severance laws.</li><li><strong>Risks:</strong> understand the risks you could be subject to if you are not complying with the local laws and regulations.</li></ol><p align='center'><img alt='Local Employer of Record laws and requirements at glance ' src='/assets/images/EOR-local-laws-requirements.png' style='width:400px !important;'></p><br><p><a target='_blank' href='https://hello.honeypot.io/b2b-employer-of-record-org/'>Get the free EOR guide</a></p><p>Happy hiring!</p>",

If they&#39;re good, they&#39;re not going to be unemployed.</p><p>That means you need to find a way to get in touch with devs who - even if they already have a good position - are still looking around and keeping their eyes open for the next opportunity.</p><h3 id='how-to-find-senior-devs-open-to-new-opportunities'>How to find senior devs open to new opportunities</h3><p>Searching through LinkedIn or other social channels to find suitable talent is hard work.

Defining a single goal at the beginning will enable you to set clear project plan and gather the right data.</li><li><strong>Gather data:</strong> Collect detailed data about the roles in your organisation, such as job descriptions, reporting structures, and responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Choose comparables:</strong> Select comparable jobs in the market for comparison. This can be done by considering aspects like the complexity of tasks, the level of responsibility, and the skills required.</li><li><strong>Collect market data:</strong> Gather information about compensation rates for comparable jobs from reliable sources like salary surveys, <a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/4773eIL'>salary reports</a>, or recruitment websites.</li><li><strong>Analyse the data:</strong> Compare your company&#39;s compensation rates with the market data. Look for disparities in pay rates, both within your organization and compared to the market.</li><li><strong>Identify pay inequities:</strong> If there are significant pay disparities, investigate the reasons. Ensure that the differences are not due to discriminatory practices.</li><li><strong>Develop an action plan:</strong> If inequities are identified, develop a plan to address them.

It gives you that edge by helping you understand what similar businesses are paying for similar roles. By fine-tuning your own pay scales accordingly, you can make sure you&#39;re offering competitive compensation packages that will keep your team happy and engaged.</p><p>First, we&#39;ll cover how exactly salary benchmarking works, and then we&#39;ll dig into the numbers from our <a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/478pnq0'>latest report</a>, which will help you understand the current European market.</p><h2 id='what-is-salary-benchmarking'>What is salary benchmarking?</h2><p>Salary benchmarking is a strategic practice that involves comparing the compensation packages of your own organization with those of your competitors or industry standards.</p><p>This process is crucial in helping businesses determine competitive salaries and other forms of compensation for their employees.</p><p>Particularly in the tech teams, effective salary benchmarking is the hiring manager&#39;s and recruiter&#39;s best tool in attracting and retaining top-tier talent.</p><h3 id='sources-to-conduct-salary-benchmarking'>Sources to conduct salary benchmarking</h3><p>There are several different sources to get data for relevant benchmarks. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Primary sources</strong>: Primary sources refer to the direct collection of data, including surveys and interviews.</li><li><strong>Secondary sources</strong>: Secondary sources are any existing online or offline resources that contain salary information, such as <a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/478pnq0'>developer salary reports</a> or government reports.</li><li><strong>Internal comparison</strong>: This method involves comparing the salaries of internal staff to determine whether they are paid fairly and in line with industry standards.</li></ul><p>No matter which method you choose, the most important thing is to ensure that all of the data is relevant and accurate.</p><h2 id='factors-to-consider-for-tech-teams-salary-benchmarks'>Factors to consider for tech teams&#39; salary benchmarks</h2><p>According to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/compensation/Pages/2024-salary-pay-raise-projection-employer-forecast-WTW.aspx'>SHRM</a>, U.S. organizations are projecting an average budget increase of 4 percent for 2024. Our <a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/478pnq0'>Developer Salary Report 2023</a> indicates a similar benchmark, revealing that European developers can anticipate an average increase of 5% from 2022 to 2023.</p><p>But creating accurate salary benchmarks for tech teams calls for a nuanced understanding of the sector&#39;s unique dynamics.</p><p>A few key factors demand our attention. We&#39;ll use examples from our <a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/478pnq0'>latest developer salary report</a> to make these factors more clear.</p><ol><li><strong>Company location:</strong> The geographical location of your company can significantly influence salary scales. Tech hubs like Berlin or high-income countries like Switzerland, for example, may command higher salaries than smaller cities or remote positions.</li></ol><p align='center'><img alt='Graph showing average offered and expected developer salary in major German cities' src='/assets/images/germany-average-offered-and-expected-salary-by-city.png' style='width:400px !important;'></p><br>  <ol start='2'><li><strong>Company size:</strong> Your company&#39;s size also matters. Larger firms often have bigger budgets and can offer more competitive salaries. However, smaller companies could provide additional perks like a flexible schedule or a more intimate team environment.</li></ol><p align='center'><img alt='Graph showing average offered and expected developer salary per company size in the Netherlands' src='/assets/images/netherlands-average-salary-offered-and-expected-by-company-size.png' style='width:400px !important;'></p><br> <ol start='3'><li><strong>Type of technology and level of specialisation:</strong> The sector your company operates in as well as the type of role you are looking for can also impact salary benchmarks. Roles involving emerging technologies or specialised skills, for instance, might command higher salaries due to their demand and the limited talent pool.</li></ol><p align='center'><img alt='Graph showing average expected developer salary per tech role in the Netherlands' src='/assets/images/netherlands-average-expected-salary-by-role.png' style='width:400px !important;'></p><br> <ol start='4'><li><strong>Years of experience:</strong> The experience level of the talent is another critical factor. Seasoned professionals with a proven track record can have very different salary expectations than less experienced or entry-level candidates.</li></ol><p align='center'><img alt='Graph showing average expected and offered developer salary per years of experience iin Germany' src='/assets/images/germany-average-offered--and-expected-salary-by-role-and-years-of-experience.png' style='width:400px !important;'></p><br> <p>By considering these factors, you will be able to construct more accurate and competitive salary benchmarks for your tech teams.</p><h2 id='how-to-start-benchmarking-tech-salaries'>How to start benchmarking (tech) salaries?</h2><p>Let&#39;s break salary benchmarking down into manageable steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Identify the key roles in your team and group them</strong>. For instance, if we&#39;re talking about a tech team, you can group the roles through classifications such as backend, frontend, and team lead.</li><li><strong>Delve deeper into the role you are benchmarking</strong>. This involves gaining a thorough understanding of the job description, from main duties to required qualifications and any specialised skills or experience needed.</li><li><strong>Scope out the job market</strong>. After we&#39;ve got a clear image of the role, our task is to find the market average. Look for roles that share similar responsibilities, qualifications, and experience levels in the same location. This will be the foundation for the salary comparison.</li><li>And finally, assemble all this information and <strong>understand the Compa Ratio of a position</strong>. More on that below.</li></ol><h3 id='what-is-a-compa-ratio-and-how-can-it-be-used'>What is a Compa Ratio and how can it be used?</h3><p>A Compa Ratio, short for Comparative Ratio, is a valuable tool in the realm of salary benchmarking.</p><p>Essentially, it quantifies an employee&#39;s salary as a percentage of the midpoint of a specific pay range. Calculating the Compa Ratio involves dividing the employee&#39;s current salary by the median salary for similar roles in the job market.</p><p>For example, a java developer with a Compa Ratio of 1, or 100%, means they are earning precisely at the market median. On the other side, a data analyst with a Compa Ratio of 0.85 is earning 15% less than the median market rate.</p><p>This crucial piece of data provides a benchmark to assess how competitive an individual&#39;s or group&#39;s pay is compared to the prevailing market rate.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, organisations can strategically adjust their compensation packages, ensuring they remain an attractive proposition for both their existing developers and potential new hires.</p><h2 id='how-to-compete-with-a-small-budget'>How to compete with a small budget</h2><p>Even with a limited budget, there are strategies that can help a company compete in the tech industry&#39;s salary race.</p><p>A crucial first step is to focus on creating an exceptional work culture. Tech professionals often value a supportive, growth-oriented workplace as much as, or even more than, high salaries.</p><p>Offering flexible working hours, remote work options, and continuous learning opportunities can significantly increase your attractiveness as an employer.</p><p>Also, consider offering equity or profit-sharing options as part of the compensation package.</p><p>Finally, remember to emphasise the unique opportunities your organisation presents, including the chance to work on innovative projects or exposure to cutting-edge technology.</p><p>By focusing on these non-monetary benefits, you can compete in the tech industry, despite having a smaller budget.</p><h2 id='download-developer-salary-report-europe-2023'>Download Developer Salary Report Europe 2023</h2><p>To stay competitive in the tech job market, it&#39;s critical for tech team leads, recruiters, and HR professionals to have an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the prevailing salary trends.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://bit.ly/478pnq0'>The Developer Salary Report 2023</a> provides up-to-date insights into salary benchmarks for tech teams across DACH, the Netherlands, and Spain.

Ein wenig technische Recherche ist hier unumgänglich.</p><h2 id='tech-lastige-vorstellungsgespräche'>Tech-lastige Vorstellungsgespräche</h2><p>Technische Fertigkeiten und Vorkenntnisse bilden die Arbeitsgrundlage eines jeden Softwareentwicklers.

      "contents": "<p>Die Rekrutierung von Fachpersonal im Technologiesektor gehört bereits zu den größten Herausforderungen vieler Personaler weltweit—Tendenz steigend. Nach aktuellen Prognosen wird die Zahl der offenen Tech-Jobs in den kommenden Jahren größtenteils zunehmen. Parallel dazu verknappt sich der Pool an qualifizierten Entwickler*innen: <strong>Bis 2030 rechnen wir mit einem</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/03/global-competition-for-technology-workers-costa.htm'><strong>weltweiten Mangel</strong></a> <strong>von mehr als 85 Millionen Tech-Fachkräften!</strong></p><p>Unter diesen Umständen ist Weitblick gefragt. Auch Unternehmen, die bereits einen robusten Bewerber-Pool aufgebaut haben, müssen vorausschauend ihre Personalbeschaffung weiterentwickeln, um konkurrenzfähig zu bleiben. Wie das mit dem sog. „Reverse Recruiting&quot; geht, erklären wir hier. Welche Leistungsindikatoren sind für die Rekrutierung von Tech-Fachkräften ausschlaggebend? Wie kommt Reverse Recruiting zum Einsatz und was gilt es dabei zu beachten? Das Wichtigste haben wir hier zusammengetragen.</p><h2 id='was-ist-reverse-recruiting'>Was ist Reverse Recruiting?</h2><p>Der Name deutet es bereits an: <strong>Bei Reverse Recruiting (Engl. „umgekehrte Rekrutierung&quot;) handelt es sich um eine Form der Personalbeschaffung, bei der sich Unternehmen bei Fachkräften bewerben und nicht andersrum</strong>. Der Rekrutierungsprozess wird buchstäblich umgekehrt, eine Art „gespiegelte Personalbeschaffung&quot;. Reverse Recruiting erfolgt in der Regel über eine Plattform (wie Honeypot) und kommt besonders häufig im Technologiesektor zum Einsatz, denn: Unternehmen müssen aufgrund des akuten Fachkräftemangels innovative Wege gehen, um qualifizierte Talente anzuwerben.</p><p>Um dieses Modell auch für Unternehmen wirksam zu gestalten, selektieren wir Entwickler*innen nach ihren beruflichen Zielen und der Dringlichkeit ihrer Jobsuche. Das verbessert die Antwortquote, ein gängiges Hindernis bei der eigenen Personalbeschaffung. Wir alle kennen das: Du findest die perfekte Kandidatin auf LinkedIn, formulierst eine persönliche und überzeugende Nachricht und dann—nichts. Das liegt daran, dass Entwickler*innen mehrmals täglich mit solchen Nachrichten konfrontiert werden. Oftmals entsprechen die angepriesenen Stellen auch gar nicht ihren Vorstellungen, also werden sie knallhart ignoriert.</p><p>Bei Reverse Recruiting steht die Fachkraft selbst im Mittelpunkt. Weil sich Arbeitgeber hier umgekehrt bei den Arbeitnehmern bewerben, <strong>verzichten die meisten Entwickler*innen inzwischen auf herkömmliche Kanäle und nutzen lieber spezielle Job-Plattformen</strong>.</p><h2 id='personalbeschaffung-mit-reverse-recruiting'>Personalbeschaffung mit Reverse Recruiting</h2><p>Diverse Indikatoren können herangezogen werden, um den Erfolg deiner Personalstrategie zu messen. Wir benennen an dieser Stelle drei davon, bei denen mit Reverse Recruiting besonders viel Optimierungspotenzial zu sehen ist.</p><h3 id='time-to-fill'>„Time-to-Fill&quot;</h3><p><a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/time-to-hire/'>Es gibt zwei KPIs</a> in Bezug auf die Zeit, die für die Besetzung einer Stelle benötigt wird. Die Begriffe „time-to-hire&quot; und „time-to-fill&quot; werden oft synonym verwendet, weisen aber bedeutende Unterschiede auf:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-to-Hire</strong> misst die Zeit zwischen der Kandidatenfindung und der Zusage des Developers.</li><li><strong>Time-to-Fill</strong> misst die Zeit zwischen der ersten Stellenausschreibung und der Zusage eines Developers.</li></ul><p>Wer diese beiden Indikatoren vernachlässigt, riskiert negative Auswirkungen. Beispiel Time-to-Hire: Hier gibt es wohl kaum Jobsuchende, die sich über ein langes Einstellungsverfahren freuen. <a target='_blank' href='https://yello.co/blog/recruiting-generation-z/'>17% aller Arbeitssuchenden der Generation Z</a> nehmen ein Stellenangebot weniger als eine Woche nach dem ersten Vorstellungsgespräch an. Vor allem bei der Gewinnung von Berufseinsteigern ist es somit entscheidend, die Zeitspanne bis zur Einstellung (Time-to-Hire) möglichst gering zu halten.</p><p><strong>Umständliche Personalabläufe mit langen Time-to-Hire-Zeiten führen auch zum Verlust hochqualifizierter Entwickler*innen</strong>, die bei einem hohen Aufkommen an Stellenangeboten schnell mal ein konkurrierendes Angebot wahrnehmen.</p><p>Bei Time-to-Fill verhält es sich ähnlich: Bis der eine Personaler die richtigen Talente ausfindig gemacht hat, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.hirevue.com/blog/recruiting-kpis-5-types-of-metrics'>hat der andere Rekruter schon sein Angebot gemacht</a>. Hinzu kommt, <strong>dass bei der Kaltakquise auf LinkedIn und Ko.</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/Talent-passive-candidates-101.html'><strong>oft nur passiv Jobsuchende angesprochen werden</strong></a>und das verlängert die Time-to-Fill-Zeit noch mehr.</p><p>Ein Tipp vorab: <strong>Stellenausschreibungen im Bereich Engineering haben vergleichsweise die höchste Time-to-Fill-Zeit</strong>. In der Praxis bedeutet das mitunter <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/faq-time-to-fill-hire'>durchschnittliche Bearbeitungszeiten</a> von 62 Tagen oder länger, bis die richtige Ingenieursfachkraft gefunden ist.</p><p>Reverse Recruiting reduziert sowohl Time-to-Hire- als auch Time-to-Fill-Zeiten, weil es gezielt Entwickler*innen anspricht, die aktiv arbeitssuchend sind. <strong>Bei Honeypot haben wir erlebt, wie so manches Unternehmen seine Time-to-Hire-Zeit von 50 auf 25 Tage</strong> halbieren konnte.</p><h3 id='cost-per-hire'>Cost-per-Hire</h3><p>Die Kosten einer Stellenbesetzung bilden einen weiteren wichtigen Leistungsindikator. Der Faktor <strong>„Cost-per-Hire&quot; misst</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://www.talentlyft.com/en/resources/what-is-cost-per-hire'><strong>den Kostenanteil des Einstellungsverfahrens für eine besetzte Stelle</strong></a> und hat <a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/cost-per-hire/'>unterschiedliche Bestandteile</a>:</p><ul><li>Werbekosten</li><li>Lizenzkosten für HR-Software</li><li>Personalkosten für interne Talentakquise</li><li>Allgemeiner Personal- und Zeitaufwand</li><li>Employer-Branding-Aktivitäten</li><li>Umzugskosten</li></ul><p>Der Kostenanteil oder „Cost-per-Hire&quot; für eine Stelle <a target='_blank' href='https://harver.com/blog/cost-per-hire/'>kann je nach Erfahrungsstufe variieren</a> und hängt auch von den jeweiligen Abteilungen ab. Mit der steigenden Nachfrage nach technischen Fachkräften <strong>fällt der Kostenanteil im ingenieurstechnischen Bereich am höchsten aus</strong>. Folglich sind Unternehmen mehr denn je bestrebt, den Faktor „Cost-per-Hire&quot; möglichst gering zu halten. Doch es gibt einen Haken: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.smartrecruiters.com/resources/glossary/cost-per-hire/'>Experten raten</a> oft dazu, in die Personalsuche ordentlich zu investieren, um eine Wachstumsstrategie mit Spitzenkräften zu realisieren. Eine sture Fixierung auf Kostenreduzierung bei Cost-per-Hire schränkt dabei nur den Handlungsspielraum ein.</p><p>Eine gute Möglichkeit der Kostenkontrolle bei gleichbleibend hoher Bewerberqualität besteht darin, sich auf die Verkürzung der Time-to-Fill-Zeiten zu konzentrieren. Die Kosten einer Kandidatensuche sind oftmals verborgen, können aber die Betriebskosten eines Unternehmens erheblich belasten.</p><p>Vergleichen wir die Kosten pro Einstellung, d.h. Cost-per-Hire, mit den Kosten für eine offene Stelle im technischen Bereich, da dort die längsten Time-to-Fill-Zeiten vorherrschen.</p><p>Der <a target='_blank' href='https://insights.dice.com/employer-resource-center/calculating-the-cost-of-vacant-tech-positions/'>durchschnittliche Kostenanteil für die Besetzung einer offenen Stelle</a> wird auf 450 € pro Tag geschätzt.</p><p>Um diesen Wert <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ere.net/cost-of-vacancy-formulas-for-recruiting-and-retention-managers/'>selbst zu ermitteln</a>, nimmt man die Gehaltskosten der ausgeschriebenen Stelle und teilt diese durch 260, also der Anzahl an Arbeitstagen im Jahr, und verdoppelt dann das Ergebnis.</p><p>Hier ist ein einfaches Rechenbeispiel:</p><ul><li>Ein <strong>Gehalt</strong> von <strong>40.000 €</strong> ergibt <strong>verborgene Kosten in Höhe von 308 € pro Tag.</strong></li><li>Ein <strong>Gehalt</strong> von <strong>60.000 €</strong> ergibt <strong>Kosten von 462 € pro Tag.</strong></li><li>Ein <strong>Gehalt</strong> von <strong>70.000 €</strong> ergibt <strong>Kosten von 538 € pro Tag.</strong></li></ul><p>Diese Kosten erfassen Dinge wie mangelnde Produktivität, verfehlte Wachstumschancen und weitere Belastungen durch Überstunden und Abwanderung aufgrund übermäßigen Arbeitsdrucks. Derartige Kostenfaktoren erscheinen nicht in der Jahresbilanz, haben aber durchaus Einfluss auf das Geschäft.</p><p>Berechnen wir auf dieser Grundlage nun die Kosten für eine offene Stelle im Tech-Bereich. Wie wir wissen, <strong>dauert es im Schnitt 62 Tage, bis eine Stelle im technischen Bereich besetzt</strong> wird. Bei einem Jahresgehalt von 50.000 € belaufen sich die Kosten demnach auf 384 × 62 = 23.808 €.</p><p>Mit Reverse Recruiting verkürzt sich die Time-to-Fill-Zeit auf 25 Tage. Allerdings ist die Nutzung von Reverse-Recruiting-Plattformen häufig mit einer Gebühr verbunden—marktüblich sind 15% des Jahresgehalts eines Bewerbers. Die Rechnung geht am Ende trotzdem auf.</p><h3 id='hier-ein-beispiel'>Hier ein Beispiel</h3><p>Die folgenden Schritte kannst du auch mit einer eigenen Stellenausschreibung durchführen.</p><p><strong>1. Schritt:</strong></p><p>Stell dir vor, du engagierst eine Entwicklerin mit einem Gehalt von 50.000 €. <strong>Dividiere jetzt das Gehalt</strong> durch die Anzahl der Arbeitstage im Jahr, also 260.</p><p>Das heißt: 50.000 € ÷ 260 = 192</p><p><strong>2. Schritt:</strong></p><p><strong>Multipliziere diese Zahl nun mit 2</strong> (macht 384).</p><p><strong>3. Schritt:</strong></p><p>Wie wir wissen, sinkt die Zeit bis zur Stellenbesetzung (Time-to-Fill) mit Reverse Recruiting auf 25 Tage. Das ergibt folgende Kalkulation:</p><p>384 × 25 + 7500 (15% des Jahresgehalts) = 17.100 €</p><p>Mit anderen Worten, eine <strong>Ersparnis von 28% oder 6.708 € pro Einstellung</strong>! Dieses Rechenbeispiel verdeutlicht das große Einsparpotenzial, wenn ein Unternehmen beispielsweise mit Reverse Recruiting zehn Entwicklerrollen besetzen möchte! Probiere es am besten gleich aus und berechne ganz konkret die verborgenen Kosten deiner offenen Positionen.</p><h3 id='anzahl-qualifizierter-bewerber'>Anzahl qualifizierter Bewerber</h3><p>Diese Kennzahl <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/qualified-candidates-recruiting-metrics'>misst den Anteil der geeigneten Bewerber</a>, also diejenigen, die die Anforderungen für eine erste Vorstellungsrunde erfüllen.</p><p>In einigen Unternehmen gibt es zwar keinen Mangel an eingehenden Bewerbungen, doch die technischen Ressorts bleiben trotzdem unterbesetzt. Wie oft hast du schon unzählige Bewerbungen gesichtet und am Ende nur eine kleine Auswahl qualifizierter Talente gefunden? Die manuelle Auswertung von massenhaften Bewerbungen wirkt sich zweifellos auf die Time-to-Fill-Zeit aus.</p><p>Es gibt unterschiedliche Ursachen für eine <a target='_blank' href='https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/qualified-candidates-recruiting-metrics'>eine geringe Anzahl geeigneter Kandidaten</a>. Zwei davon möchten wir euch hier vorstellen, da sie häufig im Tech-Recruiting auftreten:</p><p><strong>1. Technisches Fachwissen</strong></p><p>Hier sehen wir das erste große Problem bei der Rekrutierung von technischen Fachkräften. <strong>Nicht jeder Mitarbeiter in der Personalbeschaffung hat einen technischen Hintergrund.</strong> Somit kann es für einen Junior-Rekruter oder einen Sourcer im technischen Bereich bisweilen schwierig sein, die Anforderungen der Personalverantwortlichen nachzuvollziehen. In der Folge verringert sich die Anzahl der qualifizierten Bewerber*innen. Wer Honeypot als Reverse-Recruiting-Plattform nutzt, bekommt einen Client Success Manager zugewiesen, um die Auswahl der richtigen Kandidaten fachlich zu unterstützen. Das eignet sich besonders gut für Personalvermittler, die weniger Erfahrung in der Tech-Branche haben und dort Unterstützung suchen.</p><p><strong>2. Attraktive Stellenbeschreibungen</strong></p><p>Es stellt sich immer wieder die Frage, ob die zugewiesenen Ressourcen auf das Kandidatenumfeld abgestimmt sind. Wie kann ich mich vergewissern, dass meine Rekruter auch die richtigen Developer finden? <strong>Hier kann es sinnvoll sein, sämtliche Stellenausschreibungen auf eine für die Zielgruppe ansprechende Formulierung zu prüfen.</strong> <a target='_blank' href='https://cult.honeypot.io/'>Schau am besten gleich bei .cult vorbei</a>, einer neuen Plattform mit Development-Inhalten, um dir Einblicke in diese Gedankenwelt zu verschaffen. :)</p><p>Die aktive Personalbeschaffung erhöht bekanntlich die Zahl der geeigneten Kandidaten—kostet bekanntlich aber auch mehr Zeit. Für technische Funktionen sind Nischenkanäle wie Reverse Recruiting erwiesene Methoden zur qualifizierten Talentfindung.</p><p><strong>Reverse-Recruiting-Plattformen bieten Filterfunktionen, damit die Suchergebnisse auch wirklich die primären Anforderungen der Kandidatensuche wiederspiegeln.</strong> Mit der richtigen Umsetzung kann sich die Zahl der qualifizierten Bewerber auf nahezu 100% erhöhen. Das ist besonders attraktiv, wenn man bedenkt, dass die Anforderungen für technische Berufe im Vergleich zu anderen Tätigkeiten eher komplex ausfallen.</p><h2 id='schlussfolgerung'>Schlussfolgerung</h2><p>Es ist kein Geheimnis, dass die Hürden bei der Gewinnung von herausragenden Tech-Talenten höher sind als in anderen Tätigkeitsfeldern. Mit dem zunehmenden Fachkräftemangel vor allem im Technologiesektor muss sich jedes Unternehmen wieder auf die Optimierung seiner Personalabläufe besinnen.</p><p>Ganz gleich, ob es darum geht, Time-to-Fill-Zeiten zu verkürzen, mehr qualifizierte Bewerber anzuziehen oder die Kosten der Stellenausschreibung zu senken: Reverse Recruiting ist der richtige Weg!
